14,1,"I’m not a linguist, but I am polylingual and know a lot about grammar and different grammar systems- but I want some help from people who actually know about linguistics! 

Right now, I’m living in Greece and working with refugees who are predominantly one ethnic group. One of my big projects has been trying to learn their language, and I’ve been writing down and trying to create a dictionary for other volunteers working with this group, as no resources exist currently. This ethnic group speaks a dialect of a dialect of Kurdish, but their specific dialect is unstandardized. Also, due to geographic separation, their ethnic group has linguistic differences within their specific dialect, so there’s a lot of disagreement about basically… everything. They all understand each other, but because I’m not a native speaker of their language, they all want me to speak with *their* specific version of the dialect, not anybody else’s. 

About half of the people I speak with insist that the language is gendered, others insist that it isn’t. And others say that it is gendered but it doesn’t matter if I use the genders because people should understand either way. There’s absolutely no consensus on how to say the word “purple”. There’s two different ways to say “tired”, but both of them use a sound I’m incapable of saying and when I say it wrong nobody knows what I’m saying. It’s incredibly frustrating while also being incredibly fulfilling.

Basically- what do people suggest that I do with this project? I can either stick to asking one person/family and collecting grammar/vocabulary that way and just accept that it’ll be somewhat wrong for other people, or I can try to widen my net and collect as much from as many people as possible and just accept that there will be constant disagreement.

59,1,"Hello everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a short backstory. I have a colleague, and she is originally from China. So, obviously, English is not her first language. She came here to study, and then she got a job here in the US. Before college, she also went to a summer language school to learn the language. She actually learned it from scratch. I dunno how it's even possible, but when she arrived in the US for the first time, she couldn't even say something like 'Hi! My name is… blah-blah.' Well, that is really impressive. Besides, it's also really brave to travel to a foreign country without speaking the language and learning it from the native environment.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I can't even imagine myself going to China without speaking the language and knowing that nobody will understand me there. I would just exit the airport building, say goodbye to them, and go home. Or, at least, I would need a guide that will go with me everywhere and explain every single bit of their culture.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, long story short, she is still learning the language. Besides, it was recently raining in our area. We left the building without umbrellas and got all wet. It was literally showering there, and I said something like, 'it's raining cats and dogs.' She blurred into a laugh, and I couldn't get what was so hilarious I said. Well, later, I've realized that it's raining cats and dogs doesn't make any sense for foreigners. Indeed, does it make any sense at all? Why do we use cats and dogs to explain the current weather?

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to use the Sentence Stack to find the origins of this idiom or at least some explanation for foreigners.

71,1,"Mods please remove if not allowed, I didn’t see alternative recommended subs for this question.

I’m pregnant with twins and as a trilingual person living in a quadrilingual household have thought quite a bit on how to pass on our languages and culture to our children. 

I speak/write Mandarin, Cantonese, and English all at native fluency. My husband speaks Korean semi-fluently, and we speak English to each other. We live with my MIL, who pretty much only speaks Korean, and will be helping with the kids. Ideally we want to pass down all of these languages to our children. Passing down both Mandarin and Cantonese is really important to me especially, because Mandarin is spoken by my parents and extended family, and Cantonese holds sentimental importance as the language of my hometown Hong Kong (which some of you must know what’s happened recently), and is a dying language. 

All of these languages will be spoken with some frequency at home, but as I’m the sole speaker of Mandarin and Cantonese I worry it will be deprioritized as a spoken language by my kids once they pick up words, just because they will likely hear Korean or English more frequently. 

I’ve heard that some trilingual households impose certain language days, like M/T english, W/TH X language, F/S Y language, and Sunday is a free choice day for the kids. But as my household doesn’t speak all of these language as common languages I feel this wouldn’t work for us.

I’m also worried whether raising quadrilingual children will be too ambitious and will ultimately confuse their language skills, although I know that bilingual children usually show no delays in language  learning, I’m not sure if this changes when there’s more languages involved.

English is my first language, so that would be preferable, but I can use sources in Japanese as well if there isn't an English translation.

92,1,"I speak both French and English, and I have noticed that the words for the seven deadly sins in both language have (sometimes quite significant) differences in semantic content.

For instance, 'greed' in English means a desire to have more than is necessary, whereas the corresponding 'avarice' in French is more about the refusal to spend or share what one has. 'Wrath' in my mind connotes a desire of vengeance, whereas the French 'colère' is equivalent to 'anger' and is not necessarily directed at someone or something.

However, since the -er ending looks like a plural ending, some native speakers have started to drop it from a singular form: so ""met"" is the new singular form and ""meter"" remains a plural form.

121,1,"Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something ""counts"" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

133,1,"My one Japanese professor recently said that Japanese pronounce (and write in katakana) English words the way they do automatically and without thinking because they are subject to 6+ years of English classes. He had us students try to transcribe less common English words to their katakana equivalent (Mine was Sears, etc.). Most of us got the answers wrong because we were going for the sound we heard more closely, but wrong. (シアーズ, but I wrote サィアーズ). Anyway, he did that exercise to prove the point that foreigners can't do it correctly, and unless they go through years of English study in Japan, never will. That didn't sit too well with me.

So I'm trying to crack the code on what happens when Japanese read English words and output (spoken/written) kana in this way and figure this out. I got my hands on some Japanese Middle school English textbooks (New Horizon 2-3), however, they are reliant on straight English-IPA, and Kana pronunciation is sparse if not available (pic). In addition, some IPA characters do not exist in Japanese, so without formal pronunciation training, I don't see the average Japanese using these characters correctly (I know I don't for English).

I've reached out to some of my Japanese friends and other Japanese teachers at my school, and they're in agreement that they ""Know how to do it but can't explain it"". Some said the best course of action was to write as many English words in what (I) thought they were pronounced in Japanese, they'd check, and I'd build up a sort of 'Kana intuition'. The results were less than ideal with less than transcription 1/2 being correct.

Last week, I got into a discussion again with the professor and he gave me some examples in that the stressed portion of the word will change the kana transcription. I guess my main point is where can I go to more in depth figure the way this happens?

135,1,"There are several hypotheses about the origin of article in Indo-European Languages. Why do Germanic and Roman languages such as English, French, Spanish, etc. use article when Slavic languages (Russian, Polish) don't? The spontaneity hypothesis of Joseph Greenberg states that languages spontaneously acquired articles. Proto IE Languages initially do not have articles, but most of the West has it, absent in the East.

This is how I understood this hypothesis of the Gothic Bible as the origin of article in IE languages: **Ulfilas** was of Greek descent but was raised with Goths. It was when he became bishop he then translated the bible from Greek to Gothic (and invented the Gothic alphabet in the process) so that his people can understand it. He probably borrowed the article along with it as he translated the bible from Koine Greek to Gothic. When Goths started to conquer most of Europe and overthrew the Western Roman Emperor, their influence spread throughout the West and it also helped the prominence of the Gothic Bible. But they don't have much influence in the East as they were still under the Eastern Emperor's authority. This probably explains why Slavic languages preserved not having articles as the Proto IE languages. The **Ulfilas Gothic Bible** and the **Gothic conquest** in the West played a huge role in the infiltration of article in IE languages in Western Europe.

For instance, if I wanted to see which languages have a (ch) sound (sorry for lack of IPA) or a (z) sound, and so on. Or perhaps even one that would filter for multiple phonemes, for example, languages that have both a (sh) sound and a (b) sound.

I know anything up this alley might be incomplete/limited in scope, but I'd be interested in any centralized tool/resource which would let me filter or search. Thanks!",Tool to search languages by specific phonemes?,"Hello,

142,1,"I have been learning German the last couple of months, and as a Bantu language first language speaker it was proving to be quite a task. The biggest challenge was differentiating between the sound denoted by ""C"" and ""S"" as well as the umlauts. It was through constant trial and error that I managed to tell them apart and pronounce them fluently. This was all due to the English alphabet and the IPA surprisingly.

I discovered that the English alphabet consists of all the groups of sounds that a human being can possibly make. That, for example, ""S"" is made of two sounds: ɛ and s and ""C"" of the sounds denoted by: s and iː . That if you take every letter of the English alphabet and break it down to its IPA equivalent, in doing so you expose the actual pronunciation. 

Another interesting example is the letter ""W"". It surprisingly should consist of these IPA symbols: j uː j uː .  It is literally double ( j uː ). This makes sense to me now why the letter is called that in the first place.

Lastly I would like to demonstrate the application of this. Take the work "" week"". To accurately pronounce it, you have to break it down to its IPA: j uː j uː iː iː k e ɪ . Then tell yourself that each symbol represents one possible sound. The outcome of this if you successfully follow the steps is an accurate pronunciation of the word. The focus of the usual spelling but on the IPA equivalent. Don't see K instead as a symbol representing the sounds: k e ɪ and ""e"" as iː instead. Lastly think of the symbols in succession and not individually e.g. schön as the symbols: ɛ s s e ɪ t ʃ ə ʊ ʌ ɪ ɛ n . I know it looks tedious but you get a sort of euphoric feeling when you pronounce the word accurately.

The reason I am sharing this is because I know it works but I am not a Phonetics student or have a degree. I just happened to discover it by accident. It is my hope that in spite of my lack of credentials that my discovery will be taken seriously that's why I have piloted it hear first to see if it there's any substance to it. It really works and on any language. Just convert it to the English alphabet and then IPA and that's it, be it a word from a Bantu language or from an Indo- European language branch, it works! East Asian languages too, I must add.

For further clarification I would be happy to answer any questions or queries. And if this blows up, I hope that it is accredited to my name, coz why not.

143,1,"Hello everyone! I am a graduate student of linguistics that is making a presentation on the article 'Diglossia' by Charles A. Ferguson.

For the entirety of my life I have heard the the name if the capitol city of Ukraine (Kyiv) pronounced as Kee-ev or Ki-ev, sorry I have never had to spell phonetically.

Recently Kyiv has been in the news a lot for obvious reasons but it is being pronounced Keev. It actually took me a few news reports to realize what city they were talking about.

199,1,"I’d like to propose that in the southern dialects of Old English, the phoneme written with &lt;y&gt; may have actually been a central unrounded vowel (probably /ɨ/ at first, then later /ɘ/) rather than the typically assumed front rounded /y/. Here’s my rationale:

 1. Precedent: Proto-Slavic underwent a similar fronting of /u/ to /ɨ/ in palatal-adjacent circumstances, which is now realised as [ɘ, ɪ] or similar in many of the West Slavic languages.

 2. The vowel system: Vowel systems with /i, y, e/ but no /ø/ tend to be unstable, but OE &lt;y&gt; seems to have remained with no /ø/-like phoneme to balance it for most of a millennium. (This is by far my weakest argument since there are plenty of examples with similarly long-lasting /y/ phonemes, e.g. Ancient Greek).

 3. Lack of /ø/: The fact that both /u/ and /o/ underwent umlaut, but /ø/ merged with /e/ while /y/ remained distinct from /i/ feels unlikely to me. If instead umlauted-/u/ had only fronted as far as [ʉ], both umlauted vowels could have unrounded to [ɨ] and [e] leaving only &lt;y&gt; as a distinct vowel.

 4. The &lt;ie&gt; diphthong: West Saxon Old English also had a diphthong &lt;ie&gt; resulting from umlauting of earlier /ɑu, eu, iu/ diphthongs. Therefore, it’s phonetic value is typically reconstructed as /iy/. So why then did scribes write this phoneme with &lt;ie&gt;? If however we take the diphthong to have been [iɨ̯], then eventually [iɘ̯], the &lt;ie&gt; spelling is perfectly logical.

 5. Kentish: The Kentish dialect of OE featured a merger of y &gt; e, which appears in some Modern English words like “merry” or “left”. If we take &lt;y&gt; to be /y/, this development seems highly unlikely. If it were instead /ɘ/ or similar, a merger with /e/ is much more reasonable.

To be clear, I don’t think any of this applies to the northern Anglian dialects, where a robust /i, y, e, ø/ distinction was maintained for some time before /y ø/ merged with /i e/. This is much more expected behaviour for front rounded vowels.

Anyway, this my pet theory that I’ve been thinking about for the past few months; feel absolutely free to tear it to shreds! I’m sure there are plenty of reasons why &lt;y&gt; = /ɨ ~ ɘ/ isn’t the usual reconstruction, and I’ve probably made plenty of mistakes and wrong assumptions about OE, so I’d love to see corrections and counter-evidence!",Could Old English &lt;y&gt; have actually been unrounded?,"I’d like to propose that in the southern dialects of Old English, the phoneme written with &lt;y&gt; may have actually been a central unrounded vowel (probably /ɨ/ at first, then later /ɘ/) rather than the typically assumed front rounded /y/.

213,1,"Hi all! 

After a recent thread about Ukrainian which I shifted a bit to talking about Rusyn vowels, I realized that I can't think of a single Slavic language in which /ɨ/ really is IPA ɨ. In Polish the sound hovers around ɪ, e, and ɘ. In Russian it's more ɯ or ɯi. Now from what I heard of Rusyn, it's more ɯ or ɤ, and their ɪ sounds like e.

So why does everyone transcribe this vowel as ɨ? Something historical? It feels frankly inaccurate for modern languages, and as these are some of the most well-known languages described as having a high central vowel, I could easier picture this actually having a rather large impact way beyond Slavic. I mean if you combine Polish and Russian it's the sound in between, but that's a weird way to do linguistics. From what I can tell, the closest I've found in Europe to actual IPA ɨ is in Romanian (yes I know it's a Romance language, not a Slavic one!), but only in ""palatalized"" contexts, otherwise even Romanian uses a back vowel.

218,1,"So I got distracted... I got a little annoyed that everyone says it is infeasible to make a syllabary for English–and it kind of is (and definitely pointless as you could never remember them all)–but Chinese has some on the range of 20,000 characters so the 15,000-odd English syllables shouldn't be TOO bad. A quick google search, and I found [this link](http://web.archive.org/web/20160822211027/http://semarch.linguistics.fas.nyu.edu/barker/Syllables/index.txt) which claimed to have (almost) all English syllables. Great! I can just do matchy match with their transcriptions right? RIGHT? Nope! They use insane phonemic transcriptions so I decided to take the last hour writing a program (it was mostly dealing with the phonemes) to convert their gibberish to IPA.

I compared their phonemic transcriptions to the (received pronunciation/UK) IPA on wiktionary to get a dictionary of transcriptions to IPA. A few caveats to the ipa:

Here is a google doc: [English Syllables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igluTEKaLTOsY7v9GMPqBs5Rm3gcw4UbkIXzJk2jYbk/edit?usp=sharing)",Who wanted to know the IPA for all English syllables?,"So I got distracted... I got a little annoyed that everyone says it is infeasible to make a syllabary for English–and it kind of is (and definitely pointless as you could never remember them all)–but Chinese has some on the range of 20,000 characters so the 15,000-odd English syllables shouldn't be TOO bad. A quick google search, and I found [this link](http://web.archive.org/web/20160822211027/http://semarch.linguistics.fas.nyu.edu/barker/Syllables/index.txt) which claimed to have (almost) all English syllables. Great! I can just do matchy match with their transcriptions right? RIGHT? Nope! They use insane phonemic transcriptions so I decided to take the last hour writing a program (it was mostly dealing with the phonemes) to convert their gibberish to IPA.

I compared their phonemic transcriptions to the (received pronunciation/UK) IPA on wiktionary to get a dictionary of transcriptions to IPA. A few caveats to the ipa:

1. I am American, the list is British, so some of these judgements (of the 1 or 2 that exist) may be inaccurate–I tried my best.
2. Some diphthongs seem to be separate syllables in the example words (especially ""ia""), I left them.

221,1,"Is there a concept of ""phonological compatibility"" that allows loans to more easily enter a foreign language? Many European languages have a pretty high number of Arabic loans and wanderworts even though direct contact with Arabic speakers was rare outside the Mediterranean. Many words of Sanskrit and Malay origin have also entered English, to the extent that few English speakers realize ""bamboo,"" ""gibbon,"" ""gecko,"" or ""compound"" originated in Southeast Asia. 

However, very few words of Sinitic origin exist in European languages. Those that exist tend to refer to specific aspects of Chinese culture, like ""feng shui,"" ""rickshaw,"" or ""char siu"" and are rarely used to describe non-Chinese or non-Asian concepts. Unlike the Arabic or Malay loans, these Chinese loans are readily recognized as foreign by English speakers. The only exceptions I can find in English are ""kumquat,"" ""ketchup,"" ""monsoon,"" and ""typhoon,"" the last of these being a special case because its pronunciation and spelling has been affected by the Greek word ""typhon."" Outside of English, the Proto-Slavic word for book *kъňiga might have come from Chinese via Turkic, but Chinese wanderworts seem exceedingly rare.

While Arabic and Malay are both incredibly different grammatically and lexically from English, they both have a phonological inventory that overlaps heavily with English and other languages of Europe. Arabic and Malay words tend to ""look"" like English or Spanish or Bulgarian words, to the extent that an English speaker may hear ""al-ʿūd"" and repeat ""a lute"" without detecting a foreign origin. Meanwhile, Sinitic languages have huge phonological and morphological differences with European languages. In addition to tonality, the nearly exclusive use monosyllabic morphemes marks Chinese words as identifiably Chinese even to Europeans with no understanding of the Chinese language. 

Is it possible that phonological and morphological differences between Chinese and English inhibit loan transmission? Could these differences give existing loans a sense of foreignness and prevent them from being used in broader speech to describe non-Chinese concepts? Are there other relationships between other languages where we can see this effect?",Do phonological differences between languages affect the likelihood of loanword transmission?,"Is there a concept of ""phonological compatibility"" that allows loans to more easily enter a foreign language?

266,1,"So, my understanding is that STRUT was originally a backed, more mid unrounded vowel after splitting from FOOT, right? And that was the original value of STRUT in North American English. Currently, STRUT is most backed in the northeast (except northern NE) and Newfoundland and most fronted in the south and midlands, and it's lowest in Canada and Pittsburgh. Did STRUT become schwa-like throughout most of NA before later shifts in different areas?

Like, apparently part of the NCVS is a backing of STRUT - so STRUT had already been centralized there, and was then backed again as part of a chain shift?

And in the Albuquerque area, men tend to have a backed STRUT vowel, while it's also slightly raised among Hispanics and not among Anglos. The raised and backed pronunciations among Hispanic men almost approach the value of BOAT.

271,1,"This question arised in my head while I was trying to a communicate with a girl in university that is constantly mumbling and has a very low voice. I constantly had to ask her repeat herself. This led me to think about my potentially damaged hearing, but also how the acoustic properties of languages work.

So I have recently been learning Russian, which is a very consonant-heavy language, where a single consonant can change the whole meaning of a sentence. Those consonants are probably the hardest sounds to percieve when you're trying to communicate with someone in a loud environment, or from a distance. You can't really yell consonants the same way you can yell vowels right?

Russian, as opposed to my mother tongue Norwegian, is very much consonant-heavy. And Norwegian is known for having a lot of different vowels, and has more emphasis on tones and vowels than Russian. Since vowels are more important for being able to understand words in Norwegian, would then Norwegian be easier to understrand in the abovementioned scenarios?

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something ""counts"" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

378,1,"Howdy,

This is something that came up in a linguistics class when talking about basic constituent order and how it can change diachronically. Usually a language has one main order, but permits other orders in non-main clauses. 

Japanese and Korean (I just say these two because I have some knowledge of them) are generally SOV or OSV, but the verb is always final. Except in constructions like (excuse the rudimentary glossing):


何これ? nani kore (what this)

뭐야 이게 mwoya ige (what-is this)

instead of 

これ何?  kore nani? (this what)

이게 뭐야 ige mwoya? (this what-is)

Now in this case, it's not so clear because it's just a copula which has been dropped in the Japanese sentence and is kind of attached to the question word in the Korean one. But it also works for verbs, I feel. Like:

動いた、これ。ugoita, kore (moved, this)

먹었어, 그거. meogeosseo, keuge (ate, that)

Isn't that an example of a non-verb final word order? I couldn't really find any literature on it. It's a somewhat informal thing, but quite common.",Word order in Japanese and Korean,"Howdy,

I really need your help. Long story short, after reading through a 17th century Croatian dictionary I came across the entry ""rekescja"", meaning ""low tide"".

One of these groups is the Saji (though that's not the name they use for themselves). The Saji are a group known to terreform moons, and create new species of animal to suite their environments. They're generally a collectivist society, based on utilitarian principles of morality for a so called collective good, they're also known to be mostly classless (most of their nations being governered by elders or millitary leaders) and pretty militaristic. 

Because of the Saji's origins as colonies, they've largely adopted Toki Pona as a universal language. Though the conlang is thought to hail from 21st century earth, it's become useful to the Saji for quick utilitarian communications often between ships, especially with trade and negotiations. It's not their main language conversionally though, being seen as a more formal tounge, almost like the use of Latin on earth. 

They're version of toki pona is also somewhat different from the original, at least in what certain words imply for them. There's simple things like the word 'mun' being used differently in a society that mostly lives on moons. Or more complicated things, like how certain compound words (or just words) have very specific connotations in their culture (such as waso being used to mean 'barbarian' more then it is for 'bird' to the Saji due to their history, to the point where they'd probably have to spefiy if they're using it for an animal).

409,1,"When studying German one learns about something called 'modal particles' basically segments of speech that communicate only modality. These are very common in informal German.

These are always explained as something English doesn't really have, but looking at the way younger generations talk, I don't think this is strictly true, unless I am mistaken regarding what precisely defines a modal particle.

Consider the following:

""Could you just stop"" - in this sentence 'just' so far as I can tell means only to communicate a sort of frustration or shock on behalf of the listener. 

""Do you want to get like McDonalds?"" - This isn't as simple as people throwing around the word 'like' wantonly. When I hear this, I interpret it as McDonald's being an example of something, a vague approximation rather than a direct call to action. If someone says ""Do you want to get McDonalds""; I take from that that the only thing they want is McDonalds unlike in the first sentence with 'like' where perhaps some other fast food place would be a valid compromise. ""Like"" tells me that it's up for suggestion.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something ""counts"" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

In French, because of grammatical gender, if you're talking about a man but you use the word ""victime"" or ""personne"" (both feminine for example) you need to use ""elle"" to refer to them. This is relatively rare though and people still just use biological gender anyway but I'm wondering if anything like this happens in English

The closest I can think of is the assumed male in English where anyone of unknown gender is asusmed male or when generally speaking. This is of course out dated and seen as sexist but is technically still English, so I know it exist in English in some form, does anyone have anymore examples?

I'm very new to the world of linguistics, so if I get stuff wrong please be gentle lol.

I was wondering if there are any languages that actually don't have a word for It or It's at all? I'm currently creating a conlang following very closely to Artefexians incredible guide on YouTube and I'm making good headway.

I've created my own grammatical case, which is actually just ablative and locative meshed together but it's the small pronouns that are giving me trouble.

One last question, are there any languages that don't have tenses, and or the tense is inferred by the speaker?

كنت قاعد بتفرج على [الفرجة](https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/main-images/qatar-block-618x415.png). و بعدين لاقيت فيلم في اسمه kinky belt. و كان فيه تاج تحته اسمه kinky. رحت قلت انقر على التاج اياه. لاقيت ٥٠,٠٠٠ صفحة فيها ٥٠٠,٠٠٠ فيديو ، و كل عنوان فيه الكلمة kinky.

 قعدت أنقر على كل فيديو و اشوف ايه الموضوع بتاع الـkinky ده. بعد تقريبا ٥ ساعات عمال أنقر زي نقار الخشب ، قلت كفاية النهارده.

بس عجبني الموضوع جدا. يعني بدل الجنس و الفسق ، أروح اجيبلي واحد أو واحدة بيحبو الضرب و أروح ارنهم علقة لغاية ما احنة الاتنين نمبست.

أنا طبعا معنديش ادوات التعذيب اللي شفتها في الافلام دي ، و لا في خاطري أني أعرض حد لإصابة خطيرة. أنا عايز بس اجرب موضوع الضرب ده بحق و حقيقي. و الحمدلله عندي كفين حديد و لو ايدي وجعتني من الضرب ممكن استخدم جاروف أو مقشة أو معلقة خشب أو شبشب أو الحزام.

 أنا كنت باخد ملحوظات و كاتب حجات في الكراسة و أنا بتفرج بس مش عارف اقرأ خطي عشان كنت منشغل باللي بيحصل قدامي. ففي شوية كلام مش عارف سياقه ، بس هحطه تحت.

For school I have to write a financial / business letter at B1 CEFR level for the subject 'Business English'. Well, I'm not very good at English language and literature myself, but I have to pass the subject to be able to continue with my studies. If I write this letter and obtain the required credits for this, I will receive an exemption. My question is whether one of your fellow brothers can write this letter for me. Of course it would be much easier for someone whose native language is English. I know I should be able to do it myself, but I really can't. The letter must be handed in on Tuesday, March 9, 11:59PM Dutch time (UTC +1).

This is a business letter about the following case. You work at 'Flowery Day', a small company in London that exports flowers. The company is in very bad shape at the moment; If things don't change soon, the company will probably go bankrupt. There are a number of reasons why the company is doing so badly. Firstly, the sales figures are disappointing. In addition, the head of administration does not have things in order, as a result of which there is no good overview of the financial situation. In addition, you suspect that the head of administration occasionally transfers money to its own bank account. You have also noticed that customers often pay very late or sometimes even do not pay for their order. In the newsletter, the management called on all employees to put forward points for improvement. You write an email to the management in which you give advice to improve the financial situation of the company.

If you have any questions or other comments (or even made the letter already), drop me a line!

Don't think that my English is good because of this message, it's all from google translate.

I will be eternally grateful to you and give you an appropriate small gift if possible. I hope something is possible!

If Turkey decided to rename their country, would we change rename turkey the food or turkey the animal to match? Or turkey slices the product? Or is it because of the phonological differences between Ukrainian and Russian that makes the update seem mire justified (although I suspect the primary impetus is the war).

Also, if this catches on and ""chicken kyiv"" becomes the new standard, would this the first instance of a forced artificial change of a borrowed word? Is it rare, or have I simply never seen a case like this before?

495,1,"(I'm not linguist/linguistics student.) So I've been read up on Austro-Tai theory because it's interesting. I even looked up Proto-Austronesian dictionary. Some of the words there reminded me of similar words in Thai (my first language.) And some of these similarities, I haven't seen them mentioned in academic works yet. Of course, as I can't do comparative methods or reconstruction by myself, I want to see linguists' takes on these words.

Then I read that Austro-Tai was first proposed around 80 years ago and since 20 years ago there has been more substantial support to the theory. Well, it makes me wonder how long I might have to wait until some linguists happen to/are able to explain the etymology of the words I'm curious about, (afterall, if the evidences permit, and I know it won't be ""the ultimate answer,"" I just want to read something.) And also, in general, for the widely acceptance/refutation of Austro-Tai and more research on it.

506,1,"see I was doing some Latin studying and I realized that they dont really have a word like ""the"" or ""a"". Instead, ""the"" is implied by the lack of another qualifier such as ""my"" or ""your"". for example, in these images, ""ea est soror"" is literally ""she is sister."" And in the second image, ""pater domi scribit"" would be ""father writes at home"" but that sounds weird in english so you are sorta advised by Duolingo to add ""the"" or ""a"" in front, as I have done in the images.  I was thinking about it, and I realized that ""the"" and ""a"" are not really necessary??? like in english, sure it would sound weird, but in theory you COULD say ""she is sister"" and i could assume ""the"" unless you added another qualifier. 

My main question here is, how come Latin doesn't seem to use ""the"" or ""a"", and rather imply it, but English and Spanish do and use their own specific word for it? How did this trait evolve in say English? is it really necessary? like if you wanted to refer to a specific one of something, why not use another qualifier?

525,1,"I'll preface this by saying that categorizing the Indigenous linguistic landscape of the southeastern United States is a pretty difficult affair, especially compared to the rest of eastern North America. This is largely due to how little documentation there was relative to other areas of North America partly due to how brutal Spanish colonization was alongside the southern US acting as a crossroads for many previously established eastern cultures to migrate further inland or across territories in response to colonization. But what surprises me is that pretty much a majority of the languages spoken along the Gulf Coast are either unclassified or determined to be isolates with the data given. For the most part, the southeastern United States is particularly dominated by the Muskogean primary language family, but the piecing together of that family alone was a pretty hefty linguistic task due to how divergent the languages are over a relatively small area, to the point where there's still academic debate over which languages fall under the family and how the subgroups should be divided. Aside from that, the only other primary language families that dot the landscape are the southern branches of families that are predominantly spread among the northern United States, like Iroquoian and Siouan. However, as soon as you leave the boundaries of the Deep South, you enter a very confusing linguistic landscape that can't even form the tiny primary families that consist of several languages that predominantly feature in Amerindian linguistics. There have been some attempts in the past to try and group them together, like Mary Haas's [Gulf language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_languages) hypothesis that attempted to group the Muskogean family with the notable linguistic isolates of Louisiana based off some sparingly convincing phonological similarities, and there's also [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calusa#Language) from Julian Granberry attempting to draw a genetic relation between the Tunica language of the lower Mississippi River Valley and the Calusa language of southwest Florida. However, neither of these efforts have received positive affirmation among Amerindian linguistic scholars.

At first, I believed that this was simply the outcome of colonization and post-colonial suppression depleting linguistic resources and endangering native speakers, but the remaining resources available for the languages of Louisiana classified as isolates shows languages with very divergent vocabularies and phonologies that make it difficult to find commonalities within. Now it's making me wonder why exactly this is the case if these languages truly do have no genetic relationship and are all distinct from each other. What exact pre-Columbian linguistic history occurred to make this the case? I have some ideas. The first is that these are the result of derelict populations who lived in the area prior to the arrival of later Mississippian peoples and the rapid shift in Mississippian culture and society that created the modern Muskogean languages; and that the words in their lexicons that seem related to proto-Muskogean terms are the result of a sprachbund that was quite likely in the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. This leads to questions that appease possibilities of the languages being of various different migratory origins, lending favor to preexisting scholarship like the [automated computational analysis](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/677911) that found some possible lexical correlation between the Chitimacha language of southeast Louisiana and the Mixe-Zoque languages of Mesoamerica. The second is that is agreeing with Haas and going with the idea that these languages are indeed related to Muskogean, which opens up a whole new world of historical linguistics that'd have to attempt to construct when this subgroup broke off from proto-Muskogean and where its speakers migrated and settled, but that's hard as, if these languages are related to Muskogean, a lot of work has to be done with the little documentation of them available to draw connections. 

And this is just in Louisiana. I can't imagine the challenge that must come with trying to reconstruct the pre-Columbian linguistic landscape of Florida or coastal Texas, but they seem to be in similar situations, in that established scholarship is tending towards the possibility that these are peoples who spoke various languages that were once part of a cohesive migratory group from the west but branched off into radically different directions trending eastwards but maintain traces of genetic relation despite the fact; and that their presence among broader Muskogean languages is likely another case of ""less organized"" societies being more prone to have their cultures erased and thus their linguistic knowledge of their broader history lost. However, there's little more I can do beyond just speculating.",Why are there so many Indigenous linguistic isolates in south Louisiana and the broader Gulf Coast?,"I'll preface this by saying that categorizing the Indigenous linguistic landscape of the southeastern United States is a pretty difficult affair, especially compared to the rest of eastern North America.

And when I try to speak Spanish, about 50% of the words that pop into my brain are Japanese. Even if I remember all the Spanish words, I end up forming them into a Japanese grammatical structure.

I’m wondering if there’s a part of the brain reserved for a native language and another part reserved for second languages, and the second languages are all contained in one place so they get jumbled up or mixed up. Or if there’s another linguistic explanation for this. I think it would be cool to start a discussion around this area and see if others has similar experiences or an explanation!

595,1,"Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.","This week's Q&amp;A thread -- please read before asking or answering a question! - February 28, 2022","Do you have a question about language or linguistics?

617,1,"I'm wondering about the origins of a phenomenon where people put a single space after a forward slash separating two words/ideas, but not before. E.g. ""a forward slash separating two words/ ideas, but not before.""

I've seen this in internet posts, but also in the credits of Netflix shows, for example. As far as I can know and can find, style guides recommend the use of either no spaces, when separating words/ideas, or a space on either side when separating two sentences / when providing an alternative phrasing. So where does this come from? It seems to happen consistently, suggesting that it's a learned pattern or a technical idiosyncracy, not just a typo.

The only references to this phenomenon I could find, were two reddit posts by other people baffled by it:
https://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/1zkztq/space_after_slash_between_words_but_not_before/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link
and
https://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/hhbxnt/should_there_be_a_space_after_the_slash/

The first link also has more real-world examples. For clarity, I'm not talking about abbreviations like ""w/ mustard"", but about the addition of a space after a space separating two alternatives.

Is this usage carried from the writer's native language, other than English? Or perhaps this is a result of how some people type on their phone?","Origin of putting a space after a slash between words, but not before","I'm wondering about the origins of a phenomenon where people put a single space after a forward slash separating two words/ideas, but not before. E.g. ""a forward slash separating two words/ ideas, but not before.""

I've seen this in internet posts, but also in the credits of Netflix shows, for example. As far as I can know and can find, style guides recommend the use of either no spaces, when separating words/ideas, or a space on either side when separating two sentences / when providing an alternative phrasing. So where does this come from? It seems to happen consistently, suggesting that it's a learned pattern or a technical idiosyncracy, not just a typo.

The only references to this phenomenon I could find, were two reddit posts by other people baffled by it:
https://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/1zkztq/space_after_slash_between_words_but_not_before/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link
and
https://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/hhbxnt/should_there_be_a_space_after_the_slash/

The first link also has more real-world examples. For clarity, I'm not talking about abbreviations like ""w/ mustard"", but about the addition of a space after a space separating two alternatives.

618,1,"I know there was a post about this a few days ago, but I wanted to make an update looking at the continual changes. I regularly listen to the BBC Newshour broadcast and have listened to the regular presenters change their pronunciation as the conflict has developed. (on mobile so not strict ipa vowels, apologies) It started with the traditional (russian?) pronunciation of “ki-ev”, and as coverage continued it progressed to the (anglicized ukrainian) “kiv”. However, (and why I’ve made the post) I’ve heard the pronunciation “ki-jev” or “kjiv”. My understanding is that this is closer to the original ukrainian. I’ve also noticed print publications changing to the Kyiv spelling. 

Are the broadcasters making their own decisions, or is there some authority advising them of the “proper” pronunciation? Not all of them are consistent, and it seems the non-british presenters stick with “ki-ev” mostly. Especially now that I’ve seen the print media making changes as well, how do editors make that decision?

636,1,"Lately I've been facinated by compound nouns, i.e nouns made up of various other nouns strung together. This feature is largely absent in my native language (spanish) and that got me curious as to how prevalent it is in other languages.

Spanish is a head-initial language so when a noun comes after another noun the second modifies the first and we usually have to link the two with a preposition, e.g:

*  'dog toy' = 'juguete de perro' *lit.* 'toy of dog'  
&amp;nbsp;

* 'running shoes' = 'zapatos para correr' *lit.* 'shoes for running'

Sometimes we can also make use of genitive(?) forms, 'agriculture subsidy' = 'subsidio agrícola' instead of 'subsidio de agricultura'.

There are also some examples of noun compounding but they are rare, and restricted to only two nouns, e.g, 'radioaficionado', 'videojuego', 'tiburón ballena', etc.

Because of this longer nouns that are compounds in english turn into a whole sentence in spanish, for instance:

* 'factory machinery cleaning instructions' = 'instrucciones para la limpieza de la maquinaria de la fábrica' *lit.* 'instructions for the cleaning of the machinery of the factory'.  
&amp;nbsp;

* 'mail office weekend schedule' = 'horario de fin de semana de la oficina de correos' *lit.* 'schedule of end of week of the office of mail'.

Hi! I’m not a linguist, only someone who loves languages and to nerd out about them (so maybe not that far? heheh), so excuse me if this is not completely clear or if incorrect terms are used and I hope this is appropriate for the sub.

In the languages I know (to some extent) there’s pairs of “verb+noun” that are almost always used together, even if there are many other verbs available that could express the action correctly (sometimes there’s two options that are commonly used, but usually not much more than that). I guess they could be called “idiomatic” (?) but in some cases they are so strongly tied together that failing to use them would sound really weird or forced, or even could “out” a speaker as non-native (although some are more flexible than others).

Examples:

&amp;#x200B;

* Spanish: Tomar una decisión. Poner atención. Tocar un instrumento. 
* English: To make a decision (US)/To take a decision (UK). To pay attention. To play an instrument. 
* French: Prendre une décision. Prêter attention. Jouer d'un instrument.
* German: Eine Entscheidung treffen. Acht geben. Ein Instrument spielen. 

I find it fascinating how each language choses a different “flavor” and how this (in my mind at least hehe) shows something about the “personality” of the languages and their way to express reality. 

It’s so interesting how most Romance languages “take” decisions but some Germanic ones “meet” them or kind of “hit” them heheh (while others make them). Or how some “play” (with) musical instruments while others “touch” them.

How is this phenomenon called (if anything)? Where can I read more about it? Where could I find extensive lists of this relationships in different languages (especially EN and DE)? 

I hope this makes any sense.

766,1,"Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.","This week's Q&amp;A thread -- please read before asking or answering a question! - February 21, 2022","Do you have a question about language or linguistics?

And in English, new pronouns have been innovated over time too (*man, y’all / youse / yinz*). So what’s up with the idea of the “closed class”? Does it just refer to parts of speech that are *less likely* to accept innovation, or is there some formal definition I’m missing?What exactly does “open / closed class” mean, and how rigorous is the distinction?",you often see mention verb noun open class languag pronoun close class e g japanes adject adverb vari class languag but mean precis obvious far pronoun japanes english convent still constrain speaker choic take random arrang syllabl say pronoun and english new pronoun innov time man yous yinz so idea close class doe refer part speech less like accept innov formal definit i miss what exactli open close class mean rigor distinct

803,1,"The dominance of the language probably declined with the push of the ""Filipino"" in the education system which is standard Tagalog. Most of the time young Cebuano speakers now use loanwords from Tagalog making some of its built-in words obsolete. Is that going to be a problem over time for the existence of the language? Maybe not, considering that Cebuano already has many Spanish loanwords (to be fair all languages in the Philippines).

According to Wikipedia

Cebuano had the largest native-language-speaking population in the Philippines from the 1950s until about the 1980s.

From what I heard, Cebuano did not pass as the official language because it contains a lot of Spanish loanwords. In which they argue that it is not very ""Filipino"". I think that is absurd. The fact that the name of the country (""Philippines"") came from its colonial times. So, if we apply the logic that the language cannot qualify because it is ""not so Filipino"" then Tagalog wouldn't fit that description as well. Chavacano should be the national language if we apply the logic of ""not so Filipino"".

There is an initiative being done by the DEPED, like the [""mother tongue""](https://www.deped.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mother-Tongue-CG.pdf) curriculum but I doubt if that would make any difference. As you can see in the document, the time window is too short. It is only taught in 1st grade to 3rd grade whereas Tagalog is taught from the start until presumably college.

The Philippines' political system can be a roadblock in preserving languages. An initiative done by a local university in Visayas for creating a Bisayâ course was blocked by the DEPED. (Tried to find the source but I think it was deleted). Nonetheless, even though I lack sources to support my previous statement, there is no doubt that the Philippines is a confederate system in which its power is concentrated in a certain region in the country. This is why President Duterte is pushing for federalism in the country but I don't think it will happen in his term.

If politics can have a significant effect on the existence of the language then what can speakers do to preserve their language? I would not complain this much if Cebuano is a minority language but it is not. I would not consider it a ""minority language"" because it is the most widely used language in Visayas and Mindanao islands, so I just feel like it deserves to be included as one of the official languages. Witnessing my language decline is like living through a less harsh version of [colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_colonialism#Philippines).

818,1,"Hello, fellow language enthusiasts! Yesterday I was reading through the first-ever book published on the inner workings of a stock market, Jewish-Spanish merchant Joseph de la Vega's 1688 ""Confusion of Confusions,"" and something caught my eye. The book is structured as a dialogue, and at one point a character begins telling a story like this:

\&gt; A speculator enters the building of the exchange, perplexed and not knowing which thought is misleading him or which is right. Then he has a sudden inspiration and calls out, *Vende los Kirios* (This is an expression of the stock exchange, the meaning of which nobody understands).

There is a footnote for the phrase, which is this:

\&gt; The Dutch version is *Verkoop de Kirien*.

This is relevant, because the financial capitol of Europe in 1688 was Amsterdam, and so it's likely that this phrase was borrowed by Spanish traders, like de la Vega, from Dutch traders (Also worth noting, the trading being done in de la Vega's exchange was in Dutch East/West India Company shares). I quickly realized that googling either version of the phrase just leads back to the book itself. It seems this is the only recorded use of the phrase on the internet!

Looking at the phrase as an L2 Spanish speaker, the trouble is obvious: what the heck is this *kiri* root all about? The first part clearly means ""Sell the,"" both in Spanish and Dutch. Judging by the -os I thought it might be a Greek singular noun being analyzed as a Spanish plural, but poking around wiktionary reveals no such Greek root, and that would not explain the Dutch having the usual pluralizer -en.

My second guess, and the hypothesis I'm currently going with, is that this is a formation based on Latin *quiri*, which means something like ""being able to."" This would make the meaning something close to:

\&gt; Sell what you can, while you can.

If it isn't Latin, there are a couple of other, much more remote possibilities. The first is that it's somehow from an Austronesian language where *kiri* means ""left,"" as in the opposite of right. In that case, the meaning is probably

\&gt; Sell those on the left.

This... doesn't seem likely at all, but the nature of colonial trade at the time was constant contact with various South Asian cultures that the Europeans would have known next to nothing about. That would at least explain the opacity of the phrase in Europe.

The other, even less-likely scenario is that it's a borrowing of Finnish *kiri* for ""spurt,"" as in a sudden growth or movement. Given the utter lack of any Finnish loans into Dutch, I doubt it highly, however its similarity to modern trading jargon would be impeccable if the meaning were

\&gt; Sell the spurt.

Linguistically unlikely, but something traders would say, a la ""Buy the dip,"" ""Sell the top,"" etc.

I’m new to linguistics, but have studied and used foreign languages for most of my career as a conference interpreter. I’ve always seen myself as a practitioner of language rather than a theorist, but I’m starting to develop an interest in the mechanics now.

There’s something I’ve always wondered about the word “next” and its equivalents in the different languages I speak. It seems that in English, when we say e.g. “next April” we’re referring to the one after this one, i.e. 2023. In other languages, it mostly means the next one to come along, so April 2022 from our perspective in Feb.
I’m not sure if this is a false friend, or just that the mapping of one semantic field onto another is not one-to-one, or maybe that is fundamentally the same thing. Any thoughts?

In a way it’s the same with other concepts. In Portuguese, the word for beach (praia) is used to refer not just to the sandy shore but also the body of water next to it. I found this out after quite a confusing discussion with relatives (Christmas!) - but it seems to be true. Maybe it comes from the fact that it also refers to the activity (fazer praia) of sunbathing, swimming, etc.

I guess these things are well known in linguistics, but I would be interested to learn more.

821,1,"TL;DR: I am not a linguist, just a social scientist who has become interested in language. I want to find out what makes a made up word easy to read or remember. I have tried information-theoretic approach, but I don't know what i am doing and I am running our of ideas of what to google.

I have become interested in how a reader would process a made up word. For the sake of an example, let's say I make up a five letter word that does not exist in English (""mavqi"", ""thhal"", etc.). What would make this word easy to read or process? What would make this words memorable?

I have been trying **information theoretic** approaches. For instance, you can compute a metric based on  how likely it is that the first letter of the made up word is the first letter of an English word, and then how likely is the second letter conditional on the first, and the third conditional on the second.

I recently saw on a wordle video, that ther are about 13000 five letter words in English (some really obscure). But you can combine the 26 letters in almost 12 million ways. I wrote an R script that creates 10000 random words and scores them in terms of how likely the next letter is based the previous one. In fact, I computed an entropy type of metric (sum of p(x\_1, x\_2) log2(p(x\_1, x\_2)) for all five letters, where p(x\_1, x\_2) is the probability that the letter x\_1 follows x\_2, which I computed myself from a fairly large corpus of texts that I dowloaded from project Gutenberg.

Letter sequences with high (\~1.5) scores were *oulor*, *awast*, *manbe*, *ghite*, which sound like they could exist, but I don't believe they do.  Letter sequences with very low scores (\~0.05) were things like zbxvk, qvqyf, etc. Half way (\~0.9) were sequences like mutjr, blykh, orefq. These sequences have some resemblance to words that could exist. What do you think? Am I on the right track?

Then it occurred to me that probably I could measure the **similarity** between the made up word and existing words. But what does word similarity mean here? Same letters? Same letters in the same position? 

I am not asking for you to solve my problem. But I honestly don't know what to read. I know probability and some information theory, but nothing about linguistics. Where should I start? Any pointers?

829,1,"Poland, while being an ethnically near-homogeneous country (sadly because of the Holocaust), has many minority languages spread across the country, large and small. Here, I will describe some of them.

The largest is the Silesian language, by far definitely the largest of the group. It is known as the ""Silesia vernacular"" (Gwara śląska) in Polish and as the Silesian language (Ślůnsko godka) in its endonymic form. It originated from a Lechitic root that eventually diverged from Polish in some way, similar to Kashubian, which we will discuss later. It is the most available non-Polish Lechitic language, even having its own Minecraft translation.

The next is Kashubian, which is my native language, and is considered a language both in Polish (język kaszubski) and in its endonym (kaszëbszczi jãzëk). It developed during the 7th-11th centuries from a mix of Old Prussian and either Polish or a Lechitic ancestor and has 5x less speakers than Silesian does, reaching ~100,000. Its culture is definitively less active than Silesia's and Kashubian could be considered moribund.

Wymysorys is a small language, the only one from its group that survived (see EXTINCT LANGUAGES for further info). It is spoken by up to 50 people and was close to extinction but a speaker of it, Tymoteusz Król, notably helped to revitalize it and save it from total extinction. It originated from multiple Germanic languages, mostly from Middle High German with heavy influence from Polish.

GÓRAL LANGUAGE(S)

The Górals living in Carpathian Poland have multiple languages that they speak, for example Rusyn in the Biezszczady Mountains, but the chief Góral lect is the Podhale dialect and related. This dialect is Polish with possible independent West Slavic roots and borrowings/derivatives from Czech and Slovak.

EXTINCT LANGUAGES

Amongst the Lechitic group and other former languages of Poland also exist many extinct languages, most notably including:

Almost the entire Bielsko-Biała language island, which included many small local dialects that were erased after ethnic cleansings during the 20th century, resulting in many people that spoke such languages leaving and coming to Germany, where they converted to German. Wymysorys was the last to survive and is spoken to this day (see a few paragraphs above).

Pomeranian is a precursor to Kashubian, having the same origins as the language it birthed. It was possibly spoken by the Pomeranians and went extinct by the 19th century, sometimes being used interchangeably with Kashubian.

Slovincian is the last on this list, a ""brother"" of Kashubian, also originating from Pomeranian. It was spoken by the Slovincians and went extinct along with its father language, which evolved into Kashubian and thus Slovincian is sometimes considered a Kashubian dialect.

Some parts were taken from tales I was told or stuff I remember from sources, and some are taken from sources that I checked during the making of this post.",Minority languages of Poland,"Poland, while being an ethnically near-homogeneous country (sadly because of the Holocaust), has many minority languages spread across the country, large and small.

The largest is the Silesian language, by far definitely the largest of the group. It is known as the ""Silesia vernacular"" (Gwara śląska) in Polish and as the Silesian language (Ślůnsko godka) in its endonymic form. It originated from a Lechitic root that eventually diverged from Polish in some way, similar to Kashubian, which we will discuss later. It is the most available non-Polish Lechitic language, even having its own Minecraft translation.

The next is Kashubian, which is my native language, and is considered a language both in Polish (język kaszubski) and in its endonym (kaszëbszczi jãzëk). It developed during the 7th-11th centuries from a mix of Old Prussian and either Polish or a Lechitic ancestor and has 5x less speakers than Silesian does, reaching ~100,000. Its culture is definitively less active than Silesia's and Kashubian could be considered moribund.

Wymysorys is a small language, the only one from its group that survived (see EXTINCT LANGUAGES for further info). It is spoken by up to 50 people and was close to extinction but a speaker of it, Tymoteusz Król, notably helped to revitalize it and save it from total extinction. It originated from multiple Germanic languages, mostly from Middle High German with heavy influence from Polish.

GÓRAL LANGUAGE(S)

The Górals living in Carpathian Poland have multiple languages that they speak, for example Rusyn in the Biezszczady Mountains, but the chief Góral lect is the Podhale dialect and related. This dialect is Polish with possible independent West Slavic roots and borrowings/derivatives from Czech and Slovak.

EXTINCT LANGUAGES

Amongst the Lechitic group and other former languages of Poland also exist many extinct languages, most notably including:

Almost the entire Bielsko-Biała language island, which included many small local dialects that were erased after ethnic cleansings during the 20th century, resulting in many people that spoke such languages leaving and coming to Germany, where they converted to German. Wymysorys was the last to survive and is spoken to this day (see a few paragraphs above).

Pomeranian is a precursor to Kashubian, having the same origins as the language it birthed. It was possibly spoken by the Pomeranians and went extinct by the 19th century, sometimes being used interchangeably with Kashubian.

Slovincian is the last on this list, a ""brother"" of Kashubian, also originating from Pomeranian. It was spoken by the Slovincians and went extinct along with its father language, which evolved into Kashubian and thus Slovincian is sometimes considered a Kashubian dialect.

858,1,"I like to go down rabbit holes and watch youtube video series like [Journey to the Microcosmos](https://www.youtube.com/c/microcosmos/videos) or [PBS Eons](https://www.youtube.com/c/eons). 

When trying to learn about the ecosystem of microorganisms, I run into this hurdle of having to learn a bunch of Latin/Greek words. I don't mind. It’s also fun to look up these organisms on Wikipedia and browse through the different languages.

For example, there is a (eukaryotic unicellular ciliate) organism called a [paramecium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramecium), from the Greek for “oblong.” In English, we just have to learn this very sciencey name, there isn’t really an alternative.

On the German site, it's called a [Pantoffeltierchen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantoffeltierchen) which means “little slipper animal” (as in house shoe). Same with Dutch Pantoffeldiertjes. 

In Japanese, it’s zouri-mushi, alluding to a type of Japanese slipper, and mushi = bug. 

In Finnish it’s a Tohvelieläimet, which I have no clue what that means but it sure isn’t Greek to me. 

I see the same for Korean, Turkish, Hungarian, Swedish…

There are other words like this, where in English, I have to learn a completely new word (ciliate), while in German the animal has a name with familiar components (Wimpertierchen = (eye)lash-animal).

This isn't always the case, e.g. eucaryote in German is just Eukaryot, and a Volvox is just a Volvox, even in Japanese and Finnish. Weird, but still easier to learn than Oligohymenophoria.

Meanwhile, a lot of [deep sea creatures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryRcPeOM1sY) often have English names that are easier to remember, such as the peacock squid, the strawberry squid, the vampire squid, the rattail fish, the psychedelic jellyfish, the owlfish, etc.

I doubt your random German speaker on the street would necessarily know what a Pantoffeltierchen is, although it would evoke an image in their minds, albeit not as accurately as the name ""strawberry squid"" might for an English speaker . Either way, it seems easier to remember these names than having to learn new words like ""rotifer"" or ""ciliate.""

Meanwhile, anglophone kids who are really into dinosaurs will learn names like triceratops, diplodocus, and parasaurolophus, although there is something to be said for how the kids’ movie Little Foot used terms like “Longneck,” “Threehorn,” “Bigmouth,” and “Spiketail” to make the world of the dinosaurs more accessible. 

My point is, that English has this relationship with Latin/Greek, where a lot of everyday words come naturally to us, but there is also this concept of there being a whole set of words that we can't always easily parse (aka [SAT-words](https://www.vocabulary.com/lists/23400)) or that ""science-y"", technical or otherwise specialized words are probably going to be of Latin origin, which creates a kind of barrier/distance to the uninitiated. I'm sure this dynamic exists in many languages, but in some languages, comparatively many scientific words are coined using familiar components, just like with the owlfish.

I’m curious to hear you guys’ thoughts on this. Do speakers of Greek have an easier time learning scientific and religious (Eucharist, homily, sacrament, evangelion) terminology? How do speakers of Romance languages like Italian, French, Spanish, Romanian, and Portuguese perceive Latin-based scientific terms? How is it in other languages? Do speakers of Farsi, Urdu, or Turkish have a similar experience with specialized words of Arabic origin as English speakers do with Latin/Greek? Conversely, does this kind of dynamic exist in Arabic, where unfamiliar specialized words are difficult to parse?

Japanese and Korean probably have something similar going with Chinese Hanzi-based words, where many Hanzi-compounds are just everyday words (or scientific terms might have even been coined in Japan during the Meiji Era), but hearing someone use unfamiliar technical terms without being able to see the Hanzi/Kanji for it might be difficult. On the other side, Chinese speakers may here new technical terms and not understand, but it wouldn't sound like a different class of words to them .

I   don't claim to be an expert. I study Spanish, French, English, and a   bit of German. I hope that by writing this question I can be led to   resources that might help me understand a bit better the **history of English sensibilities and aesthetics.**

I   don't claim that any culture is better than another. I'm only trying  to  understand the differences. I will focus primarily on music since  it's  easier to bring concrete examples.

**Romance Languages**

It   seems in Romance languages you can write a sad song and it would be   fine. For instance, there have been some Spanish-speaking bands that   have covered the song, ""Last Kiss."" It seems the audience and critics   who listen to the song like it. There are other sad songs like the   Italian, ""Il ragazzo della via Gluck."" Listening to sad songs seems to   be primarily **an ""emotional experience""**   and listeners and critics listen to the song and either like it or  not.  There seems to be a more 1 to 1 conversation between the listener  and  songwriter.

**English**

It seems English is way harder to write a straightforward sad song. Since it seems listeners and audiences are trying to ""**intellectualize"" their listening experience.**   For instance, in the ""Last Kiss"" song people thought it was   ""manipulative"" since it wanted to make you feel sad. There's a   historical reason as to why this happened since those ""teen tragedy""   songs were popular around that time.

However, what I'm arguing is that in general, it seems that the **Anglosphere has a differen**t **""aesthetic ideal"" than the Romance languages.**   To me, the English ideal is Morrisey the English-Irish singer.  Morrisey  writes a song that is sarcastic and rarely straightforward.  For  instance, the song, ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" is meant to be sad but  it's a  juxtaposition of sad lyrics with a happy tune. **I think with his song you'll have to sit down and ""read between the lines"" to get the meaning.**

**My theory**

**Protestantism:**   It seems in Protestant cultures there's a strong preference for ""not   being pretentious."" Pretentious is loosely defined since it seems that   many things might be pretentious in one culture while normal in another.   In German, I saw some traces of Protestant aesthetics.

**English and Irish Relationship**   It seems that many Irish writers developed a way of writing to   criticize the UK's treatment of Irish people hence this type of   sarcastic writing took shape.

**Class-based culture** Because of the class structure in English society it seems that regular people can't express what they feel directly.",History of English sensibilities and Aesthetics: Why does it seem its easier to write straightforward sad songs in Romance Languages but harder in English? (Evidence provided inside),"Hello everyone,

I   don't claim to be an expert. I study Spanish, French, English, and a   bit of German. I hope that by writing this question I can be led to   resources that might help me understand a bit better the **history of English sensibilities and aesthetics.**

I   don't claim that any culture is better than another. I'm only trying  to  understand the differences. I will focus primarily on music since  it's  easier to bring concrete examples.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.","This week's Q&amp;A thread -- please read before asking or answering a question! - February 14, 2022","Do you have a question about language or linguistics?

Hello there! My name is Marie G., and I'm a last semester student of electronics engineering at [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk/). As my final project, I've decided on making a speech-to-IPA tool, which I can see is something people have asked for here on r/linguistics over the years. I have a few questions that would help steer me in the right direction, so if you have the time and interest, I'd appreciate any and all responses you have for me. **I'll present a little bit about the project and my own interest in it, but you can just skip to the bottom for the questions if you'd like.**

# What do I mean by a speech-to-IPA tool?

A software or device that is capable of phonetically transcribing either audio clips or live speech, with the output being written using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

# How do I plan on making this?

Signal processing is a part of my education. In short, this involves analyzing, modifying and synthesizing signals, e.g. audio signals. You may be familiar with audio signal processing through things such as voice assistants, automatically generated captions, language learning apps, electric guitar pedals, auto-tuning - you name it.

Audio is saved digitally by translating audio waves into an electrical signal, and then sampling the intensity of this signal at regular intervals. Looking at how these samples change over time, it's possible to divide the signal into different frequency components. When doing so, you can e.g. extract the formants that make up voiced speech. From there, it's a matter of describing the frequency patterns over time in a way so that they match transcription done by humans.

The basic theory for this type of signal processing already exists, it's just a matter of shaping it into something that works reliably for IPA transcriptions - which is probably easier said than done, but what's life without a little challenge?

# What are my restrictions/boundaries due to this being a university project?

First of all, AAU cares a lot about a technique called [problem-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-based_learning). For us students, this means that half of our time at university is spent working on projects - and they have to have real life use cases. In my case, my supervisor has accepted speech-to-IPA, given that it can be used by linguists, as well as people with hearing/speech impairments or otherwise hoping to train their pronunciation.

Next, it has to be capable of running in real-time, ie. output can be delivered faster than it takes for a new input to arrive. I've cleared it up with my supervisor, and it means I can still program a software that uses pre-recorded audio clips, but the algorithms I come up with have to be so quick that they could - if you bothered to program it that way - run in real-time. So what does this mean in lay terms? It means that if I input 10 seconds of audio, my software should not take longer than 10 seconds to transcribe it.

# When is the project due?

I've just begun working on the project, and I believe my deadline is sometime late May. I'll be working full-time on it, but it still means that in the coming 3-4 months, my main goal is to build a program that demonstrates the concept, and whatever time I have left I can spend on expanding and refining. For this reason, I don't expect my first iterations to be ready for real life use.

# Will I continue working on it after the deadline?

Maybe. It's too early to tell how promising my work is, but I'd likely want to continue working on it in my spare time, just out of personal interest.

# What is this personal interest I speak of?

I've been curious about linguistics since my pre-teen years. I remember finding my father's Teach Yourself language books on the shelf and abducting them, and I believe that's where it started. The differences and similarities really caught my attention, and I started playing around with creating my own languages too. I excelled when it came to linguistics in school, and I loved it. Sadly I lost a bit of my momentum with it after high school, but I still find myself drawn to the topic whenever I come across it.

About a year and a half ago, after I finally got a hearing aid for my bad ear, I became increasingly curious about something I never quite understood back then - what speech actually looks like when you break it down, and why hearing loss in certain frequencies makes certain sounds indistinguishable from each other.

This sent me down a path of wanting to create a speech synthesizer using IPA as input. Then, before I really got started, I realized that what I was doing could very well be a final project, so I held on for a good while. I talked with one researcher here at my university who thought it was interesting, but maybe a bit of a mouthful for one semester. In addition to that, synthesizing speech would require much of the same analysis that making a speech-to-IPA tool would, so choosing to focus on that was not a bad compromise for me at all.

And finally...

# Questions

You don't have to answer everything, and you don't have to answer in bullet points or in order. You can just think of these questions as conversation prompts. If you have anything to add that I didn't include, feel free to!

* Which type(s) of work/projects do you make IPA transcriptions for? Specific examples are appreciated.
* Have you ever used a speech-to-IPA tool?
   * If no, have you been in a situation where you have thought about or searched for one?
   * If yes, which one(s)? What did/didn't you like about the tool you used? Is there anything in particular the tool was missing that you wish it had?
* How much time/work do you estimate a flawless automated speech-to-IPA tool could save you compared to manual transcription?
* What environment are the audio clips you use typically recorded in? Think in relation to distance from microphone, background noise, overlapping speakers, reverb, and so on.

**Please let me know if you don't want to be quoted, or if you want to be quoted anonymously for any reason.** I don't know yet if I'll be quoting anyone in my report, but I do want to keep the option available :)",[University project] Looking for responses regarding IPA transcription and speech-to-IPA tools,"(This is posted with permission from the moderators)

Consider: We have countless options when it comes to expressing our basic distaste for Ann Coulter. We can use a predicate adjective (“Ann Coulter is awful”). We can opt for an attributive adjective and a noun (“Ann Coulter is an awful person”). We can let the verb do more work (""Ann Coulter disgusts me”). We can find any number of more complex ways to express this very simple and important idea.

&gt; But now try to simplify the sentence while saying the same thing. I think you’ll find the most direct route is the intransitive verb. “Ann Coulter sucks/blows/stinks/rots/bites.” Notice something about all those verbs? They’re vulgar, to varying degrees. Can you find an intransitive verb that expresses the same idea, but in a manner that wouldn’t seem out of place in formal speech? Because I can’t. For some reason, this construction is innately casual. (The same is true with the only two intransitive verbs I can think of to express basic admiration: “Kate Winslet rules/rocks.” Not vulgar, but still clearly slang.)

Though, in hindsight, it seems a bit obvious (given the existence of the verb *to be* in English), I thought it was a rather interesting point, considering that something's merit or quality seems like something perfect for intransitive verbs, given that it's not something that is applied to something else.

Is this the case in many other languages? The only other language I'm reasonably familiar with is Spanish, where intransitive descriptors of merit are even less common. Off the top of my head, the one intransitive Spanish verb I can think of  that pertained to merit would be *apestar* (which literally means *stink*, but is more comparable in strength to *suck*).",An article I read brought up a good point about how rare it was for intransitive verbs to denote merit.,"https://slate.com/human-interest/2006/08/a-defense-of-the-word-sucks.html

1) What’s the transcription of “bowl” in General American English? (I’m from Chicago and have a standard American accent). I’ve seen [oʊ] but that is not what I hear. That would sound like a regional accent, like “bOHl”. It can’t be [ɔ] either, because that would be “ball”. It sounds like [o] to me, but I never considered that to be a vowel in general American English. Is it? Or is this just me? Or is it the [oʊ] losing its diphthong before the [l]?

2) I’ve seen “air” transcribed as [ɛɚ] and [ɛɹ]. Neither of these seem right to me for General American English.

post-migration period (5th–7th centuries): the Slavs came to present-day Slovakia from various locations; Western and Eastern Slovakia was settled by people who spoke Northwestern (West Slavic) Proto-Slavic dialect, Central Slovakia by speakers of the Southeastern (non-West Slavic) dialect.
integration period (8th–9th centuries): several language features (both West and non-West Slavic) spread across the borders of the initial linguistic regions; these changes are best explained by the integration process of the Slavs before and during the existence of Great Moravia.
constitutive period (10th–11th centuries): After the extinction of Proto-Slavic, Slovak began to evolve as a separate Slavic language.

In this paper submitted by u/PyrolatrousCoagulate, Dąbkowski presents a typology of free affix order, and discusses how it is present in Paraguayan Guaraní. Free affix order (FAO) describes the phenomenon in which affixes may change their position freely without any modification in meaning. FAO contrasts with scopal and templatic affix order. In scopal affix order, affixes may change their order, but then this also changes the semantics of the whole word. In templatic affix order, the order of affixes is invariant, but their scope may vary. It is this threefold distinction that is probably the most interesting to us conlangers. Now onto the prompts:

* Which one of the three affix order types is present in your language? Is there another one that is not described in the paper?
    * Which affixes are affected by this? E.g. can only valency-modifying affixes be scopal?
    * How does FAO or other affix order types interact with other parts of your language's morphology?

Four days ago, I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/tk9pb0/what_makes_a_language_easy_to_learn_and_use/) post here on r/conlangs asking what makes a language easy to learn and use.

From the comments on that post, I decided to go with strict grammar rules, possibly 0 exceptions (but that is up to the computer to decide).

What will humans decide?
- Grammar tenses
- Min and max word length
- How easy to learn and use the language is
- Phonetics

What will the computer decide?
- Syllable order
- What words mean what
- How grammar tenses are going to be implemented
- Word order
- Any possible grammar rule exceptions

Grammar tenses: present, past, future.

Min word length 1 character and max word length of 15 characters.

Phonetics:
For now I have chosen the phonetic alphabet of Toki Pona.

The u-umlaut is mainly used to write words associated with evil. This is because this letter looks so nazi to me.

The ß is used as /bj/ because when I first saw it, I though it is 'b'. I don't care about german ortography!

So many variants of the u letter may be problematic, but this is evolving. Especially when writing on minecraft signs, where pasting is not allowed.

**Grammar**

*Persons*

| I | űm |
|:----:|:----:|
| You | Sze |
| He | Ce |
| She | Col |
| It | Ocs |
| We | Gen |
| You (plural) | Werj |
| They | Rjűn |

The 'to be' verb is the default and does not exist.

*Plural number*

Add -(zh)i suffix

avar (shadow) --&gt; avari (shadows)

*This*

Use 'szé'

avar (shadow) --&gt; szé avar (this shadow)

ürk (orc) --&gt; szé ürk (this orc)

As you can see, the u-umlaut is used here in the orc word.

*Creating adjectives from nouns*

Every adjective here ends in -(i)n suffix, so just add it!

avar (shadow) --&gt; avarin (dark)

*Imperative*

As every verb ends in -o, delete it, and double the consonant:

pôdo (to speak) --&gt; pôdd! (speak!)

laho (to burn) --&gt; lahh! (burn!)

*Diminutives*

Add the -(i)k suffix

edan (man) --&gt; edanik (guy)

*Magnification*

Add the -(u)m suffix

avar (dark) --&gt; avarum (darkness)

This is actually implemented from black speech (or sauron just copied this, idk)

*Ownerships*

Swap the thing with the person

nűr (hause, home) --&gt; nűr űm (my house/home)

while 'űm nűr' means ""i'm a hause"", so remember about swaps!

*Past time*

Add the -t suffix to the person:

űm aragin (i'm strong) --&gt; űmt aragin (i was strong)

if there is no person present, add it to the name:

Aragorn arűgin (Aragorn is strong) --&gt; Aragont arűgin (Aragorn was strong)

*Future time*

The same, but with -(y)e suffix:

űm aragin --&gt; űme aragin

Aragorn arűgin --&gt; Aragorne arűgin

*Gradation of adjectives*

| | equal | higher | the highest |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| word | avarin (dark) | avaren (darker) | avaron (the darkest) |
| suffix | -in | -en | -on |

*Questions*

Just add the correct question mark before the sentence.

""If"" is the default and it is not written nor spoken.

| English | Avarin |
|:-----:|:----:|
| Who/what | Es |
| How | Er |
| Where | Gwe |
| How much | Hôn |

**Sample Text 1**

I was reading about something called e-prime, a form of english which claims to ""lead to a less dogmatic style of language that reduces the possibility of misunderstanding or conflict."" While it seems that e-prime has failed in this regard, i'm curious as to what a language designed with that idea in mind would look like.

I've also read about a language called tuyuga. according to [this website](https://www.ranker.com/list/weird-languages/kellen-perry), tuyuca requires people to ""fact check"" as they speak; ""The verbs in Tuyuca require a sense of *how the speaker knows something*. You can’t just say “The boy played soccer,” as *The Economist* notes. You have to say, for example, ""The boy played soccer (I know because I saw him)” (*diga ape-wi*) or “The boy played soccer (I *assume*)” (*diga ape-hiyi*)."" This sounds like it would reduce misinformation, but doesn't sound like it would eliminate the possibility of, say, lying or misremembering. I'm curious about the effects of tuyuga on speakers in the sapir-whorf sense.

Any insight on this matter would be appreciated!","What features would a ""less dogmatic"" language have?","

I had been thinking about translating recipes to check on my numbers, quantities and whatnot. I thought the biggest challenge would be just coming up with vocabulary for food items, but I had no idea how many questions and rabbit holes this simple recipe would bring up. I figured I'd share them here.

As a light intro, the language is a (hopefully plausible) member of the Mesoamerican Language Area. It is VSO, head-initial, and head-marking. The following posts are the foundation for the language. They are for the parent language, but most of the mechanics are still valid:

# Notes

**\[Gloss1\]**: Going from base 10 to base 16 is a pain. Add to this possibly converting between native units (based on base 16) seems to make keeping two systems current in a culture difficult. Same base with different units is obviously done in real life (1 in. = 2.54cm). Going from 180 (base 10) degrees to B4 (base 16) degrees was straightforward. I had a hard time going from 20 (base 10) cm to A (base 16) aalju. Maybe its just a matter of not being used to the new units.

See Note \[Step2b\] below for more on native units.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Ingr1\]**: Like English ""cup"" and Spanish ""taza"", mintu is a generic term for a vessel made to hold liquid and is used for both for drinking and for measuring.

* **ŋkittaw**: ear of corn (\~1 pound, \~500 g)
* **tiŋki**: a kernel of corn, 1/1024 *ŋkittaw*

So the gram ingredients in native units would be about:

&gt;  
&gt;ATTR-112 8 ATTR-cup ATTR-powder wheat

120 *tiŋki* of flour

I think a native writer/cook would round the *tinki* amounts to base 16 numbers which were multiples of 8 (like multiples of 5 in base 10)

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Step1a\]**: What voice to use for recipes? English uses familiar commands (Cover X. Mix Y. No ""please""). Spanish uses infinitives or familiar commands. Ic̣aa'jansi has a dictionary form, like an infinitive, but it also has obligatory agreement markers for subject and object. Ultimately, I went with 2nd person, ""You cover X. You mix Y."" I figure this is a leftover from passing down recipes in an oral tradition.

&gt;  
&gt;ATTR-thirty.two eight-ish unit.of.length

## Units of Length: SI

This was a huge rabbit hole for me. The SI has a nice system of prefixes for larger and smaller units, but it's all base 10. There are of course words for ten and one hundred in Ic̣aa'janşi, so it would be possible to keep this concept going, but they wouldn't be nice, simple numbers. It would turn out something like imperial units: 1 mile = 8 furlongs = 1760 yards = 5480 feet.

Here's a sample of some multiples of 10 in Ic̣aa'janşi:

* 10: *raansa* (A)
* 100: *niilişu iinsa* (64)
* 10^(2\^) (""ten to the power of two""): *'araansa 'akiija nsansa*
* 1/10: *aʃaraansa* (1/A)
* 1/100: *aʃaniilişu iinsa* (1/64)

It could work, but it's not intuitive and the digits don't show a clear pattern by going up a multiple of the base used in the language (i.e. 10, 100, 1000). So calquing SI prefixes like deci- (1/10) and centi- (1/100) is out.

But if the language doesn't like dividing a meter by multiples of ten, how is a meter any better than a yard or a native kinda-close-to-a-meter standard (*tintu*)? Why even use the word ""meter""? Why not something like:

* *'atintu iwrupa* (European *tintu*)
* *'atintu si* (tintu of the SI)

But then you are still left with the problem of translations of the smaller/bigger units.

Ultimately, I think pressure for being a part of the global scientific community would force the adoption of the SI with base 10 in certain situations (academia). Counting in a lower base seems easier than counting in a higher base because one just needs to cut off the normal counting earlier; there is nothing new added. Then the native base 16 measurements would continue to be used in parallel. When using native units, base 16 is assumed. When using SI units, base 10 is used. So meters &amp; centimeters are loaned into the language!

* mitiru (&lt; Spanish *metro*)
* sintimitiru (&lt; Spanish *centímetro*)

Switching between bases, at some point, someone will need to ask, ""Wait, is that ""ten"" you just said base 10 or base 16?"" If the Ic̣aa people are switching between base 10 and base 16, I think  they would try to find a colloquial term for base 10.  Here are some options I thought of, but I haven't settled on one yet.

* *c̣iiḷu* (small hand/15)
* *'arittaw raansa* (finger 10)
* *'ansajunʃi raansa* (base/radix 10)
* *'aiinsiʃu iwrupa* (European 16 (10 in base 16))
* *'ansajunʃi c̣iiḷu* (small hand base)
* *c̣iiinsiʃu* (small 16)
* *'ansansa c̣iiḷu* (two small hands/15)
* *'aiǁu raansa* (hand 10)
* *'ansajunʃi rittaw* (finger base)
* *'akiija raansa* (exponent 10)

Like I said, a rabbit hole of math and language and worldbuilding. Moving on...

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Step4\]**: How to deal with a series of conjunctions (X and Y and Z)?

* X, Y, and Z (conjunction only between last 2 elements)
* X and Y, Z (conjunction only between first 2 elements)
* X and Y and Z (conjunction between every element)
* other methods...?

I currently use the 3rd pattern, but I'm not sure that will stay. I'm curious if anyone has anything interesting with conjunctions patterns like this?

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Step6\]**: Spread and batter have the same root (*θepʼ*).

* **sip̣a** (to spread) &lt; siʘaʔa &lt; θepʼfaʔ &lt; θepʼfaʔ (spread+action)
* **siⁿşiu** (batter, dough, masa) &lt; siʘiⁿʃju &lt; θepʼeⁿʃium &lt; θepʼŋʃium (spread+material)

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Step7a\]**: Not sure if using the cessative aspect here make sense: stop baking at 25 minutes. It seems like there is a jump between spreading batter and stopping baking. ""You told me when to stop baking, but when was I supposed to start?""

If anyone with experience dealing languages that have cessative aspect, I'd love to hear thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Step7b\]**: omg more units

## Units of Time: Ic̣aa

* *mjataw*: 1 day
* *aataaw*: 1/16 day (5400 seconds, 1.5 hours)
* *aʃaataaw*: 1/16 division of an *aataaw* (5.625 minutes)
* *aari*: 1/16 division of an *aşaataaw* (\~21.1 seconds)

# Wrapup

That's it for this recipe. With derivations of various roots, I wound up adding over 100 words to my lexicon which was fun. Lots of reading etymologies of foods and cooking methods and thinking about how people long ago would conceptualize things. What foods would be native (vanilla) what would arrive with Europeans (dairy), what foreign words to romanize, what to calque, and on and on.

Credit where it's due. Many thanks to [this recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10549/best-brownies/) as base. (I didn't make the icing.) In addition to the brownie, my photo also has:

* *'ailatu ŋkamwa*: vanilla ice cream
* *pulatanu*: banana
* *'ajunşu ulamunşi mujaaŋi*: powdered peanut butter

I'm pretty happy with how this turned out. If you read all the way to the end, thanks! I wish I could give you a brownie for real!",Who wants brownies? A recipe in Ic̣aa'janşi,"I made *'apisikuşu lunjaa'a* (a.k.a. brownies)!

*Processing img e0zemby4hjp81...*

I had been thinking about translating recipes to check on my numbers, quantities and whatnot. I thought the biggest challenge would be just coming up with vocabulary for food items, but I had no idea how many questions and rabbit holes this simple recipe would bring up. I figured I'd share them here.

As a light intro, the language is a (hopefully plausible) member of the Mesoamerican Language Area. It is VSO, head-initial, and head-marking. The following posts are the foundation for the language. They are for the parent language, but most of the mechanics are still valid:

# Notes

**\[Gloss1\]**: Going from base 10 to base 16 is a pain. Add to this possibly converting between native units (based on base 16) seems to make keeping two systems current in a culture difficult. Same base with different units is obviously done in real life (1 in. = 2.54cm). Going from 180 (base 10) degrees to B4 (base 16) degrees was straightforward. I had a hard time going from 20 (base 10) cm to A (base 16) aalju. Maybe its just a matter of not being used to the new units.

See Note \[Step2b\] below for more on native units.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Ingr1\]**: Like English ""cup"" and Spanish ""taza"", mintu is a generic term for a vessel made to hold liquid and is used for both for drinking and for measuring.

Units of Weight/Mass: SI

* **kuramu** (&lt; Spanish *gramo*)

See Note \[Step2b\] below for more details on SI units.

## Units of Weight/Mass: Ic̣aa

* **ŋkittaw**: ear of corn (\~1 pound, \~500 g)
* **tiŋki**: a kernel of corn, 1/1024 *ŋkittaw*

So the gram ingredients in native units would be about:

**'a-B4 'atiŋki junşu**

&gt;  
&gt;ATTR-112 8 ATTR-cup ATTR-powder wheat

120 *tiŋki* of flour

I think a native writer/cook would round the *tinki* amounts to base 16 numbers which were multiples of 8 (like multiples of 5 in base 10)

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Step1a\]**: What voice to use for recipes? English uses familiar commands (Cover X. Mix Y. No ""please""). Spanish uses infinitives or familiar commands. Ic̣aa'jansi has a dictionary form, like an infinitive, but it also has obligatory agreement markers for subject and object. Ultimately, I went with 2nd person, ""You cover X. You mix Y."" I figure this is a leftover from passing down recipes in an oral tradition.

&gt;  
&gt;ATTR-thirty.two eight-ish unit.of.length

## Units of Length: SI

This was a huge rabbit hole for me. The SI has a nice system of prefixes for larger and smaller units, but it's all base 10. There are of course words for ten and one hundred in Ic̣aa'janşi, so it would be possible to keep this concept going, but they wouldn't be nice, simple numbers. It would turn out something like imperial units: 1 mile = 8 furlongs = 1760 yards = 5480 feet.

Here's a sample of some multiples of 10 in Ic̣aa'janşi:

* 10: *raansa* (A)
* 100: *niilişu iinsa* (64)
* 10^(2\^) (""ten to the power of two""): *'araansa 'akiija nsansa*
* 1/10: *aʃaraansa* (1/A)
* 1/100: *aʃaniilişu iinsa* (1/64)

It could work, but it's not intuitive and the digits don't show a clear pattern by going up a multiple of the base used in the language (i.e. 10, 100, 1000). So calquing SI prefixes like deci- (1/10) and centi- (1/100) is out.

But if the language doesn't like dividing a meter by multiples of ten, how is a meter any better than a yard or a native kinda-close-to-a-meter standard (*tintu*)? Why even use the word ""meter""? Why not something like:

* *'atintu iwrupa* (European *tintu*)
* *'atintu si* (tintu of the SI)

But then you are still left with the problem of translations of the smaller/bigger units.

Ultimately, I think pressure for being a part of the global scientific community would force the adoption of the SI with base 10 in certain situations (academia). Counting in a lower base seems easier than counting in a higher base because one just needs to cut off the normal counting earlier; there is nothing new added. Then the native base 16 measurements would continue to be used in parallel. When using native units, base 16 is assumed. When using SI units, base 10 is used. So meters &amp; centimeters are loaned into the language!

* mitiru (&lt; Spanish *metro*)
* sintimitiru (&lt; Spanish *centímetro*)

Switching between bases, at some point, someone will need to ask, ""Wait, is that ""ten"" you just said base 10 or base 16?"" If the Ic̣aa people are switching between base 10 and base 16, I think  they would try to find a colloquial term for base 10.  Here are some options I thought of, but I haven't settled on one yet.

* *c̣iiḷu* (small hand/15)
* *'arittaw raansa* (finger 10)
* *'ansajunʃi raansa* (base/radix 10)
* *'aiinsiʃu iwrupa* (European 16 (10 in base 16))
* *'ansajunʃi c̣iiḷu* (small hand base)
* *c̣iiinsiʃu* (small 16)
* *'ansansa c̣iiḷu* (two small hands/15)
* *'aiǁu raansa* (hand 10)
* *'ansajunʃi rittaw* (finger base)
* *'akiija raansa* (exponent 10)

Like I said, a rabbit hole of math and language and worldbuilding. Moving on...

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Step4\]**: How to deal with a series of conjunctions (X and Y and Z)?

* X, Y, and Z (conjunction only between last 2 elements)
* X and Y, Z (conjunction only between first 2 elements)
* X and Y and Z (conjunction between every element)
* other methods...?

I currently use the 3rd pattern, but I'm not sure that will stay. I'm curious if anyone has anything interesting with conjunctions patterns like this?

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Step6\]**: Spread and batter have the same root (*θepʼ*).

* **sip̣a** (to spread) &lt; siʘaʔa &lt; θepʼfaʔ &lt; θepʼfaʔ (spread+action)
* **siⁿşiu** (batter, dough, masa) &lt; siʘiⁿʃju &lt; θepʼeⁿʃium &lt; θepʼŋʃium (spread+material)

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Step7a\]**: Not sure if using the cessative aspect here make sense: stop baking at 25 minutes. It seems like there is a jump between spreading batter and stopping baking. ""You told me when to stop baking, but when was I supposed to start?""

If anyone with experience dealing languages that have cessative aspect, I'd love to hear thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Step7b\]**: omg more units

## Units of Time: Ic̣aa

* *mjataw*: 1 day
* *aataaw*: 1/16 day (5400 seconds, 1.5 hours)
* *aʃaataaw*: 1/16 division of an *aataaw* (5.625 minutes)

# Wrapup

That's it for this recipe. With derivations of various roots, I wound up adding over 100 words to my lexicon which was fun. Lots of reading etymologies of foods and cooking methods and thinking about how people long ago would conceptualize things. What foods would be native (vanilla) what would arrive with Europeans (dairy), what foreign words to romanize, what to calque, and on and on.

Credit where it's due. Many thanks to [this recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10549/best-brownies/) as base. (I didn't make the icing.) In addition to the brownie, my photo also has:

* *'ailatu ŋkamwa*: vanilla ice cream
* *pulatanu*: banana
* *'ajunşu ulamunşi mujaaŋi*: powdered peanut butter

I'm pretty happy with how this turned out. If you read all the way to the end, thanks! I wish I could give you a brownie for real!Who wants brownies?

&amp;#x200B;

Britagne is a Romance spoken in sparsely in southern England, and my homeland, the southern Appalachians. Britagne is my second Romance language. It is a considerable departure from the more conservative Africana, and has many features that are very unique to this form of Romance. Without further ado, I will now present to you, Britagne.

&amp;#x200B;

# Phonology

Britagne has a phonology similar to the languages to that of French, but with a few distinctions

&amp;#x200B;

||Labial|Alveolar|Post alveolar|dorsal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nasal|m|n||ɲ (ŋ)|
|Plosive|p b|t d||k g|
|Fricative|f v|s|ʃ ʒ||
|liquid||l||j ʀ|
||||||
|close|i ĩ y ỹ|u ũ|||
|close-mid|e ẽ ø ø̃|o õ|||
|open-mid|ɛ ɛ̃||||
|open|a ã||||

One unique quirk of the Britagne phonology is that the vowels /y/ /ø/ and /ɛ/ are derived from a sound change similar to umlaut. This change has been fossilized in spelling in the form of a silent &lt;e&gt; at the end of affected words. For example, what was originally /kanem/ (spelled canem) in Latin now becomes /ʃɛ̃/ (spelled chane) in Britagne.

&amp;#x200B;

# Nouns

Similar to French, Britagne has pretty much lost the gender system of Latin entirely. The only time grammatical gender matters in the language is for articles. Here is the derivation system for nouns

&amp;#x200B;

||Masculine|Feminine|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Singular|Le/un chane|la femin|
|Plural|les/uns chanes|las femins|

Pronouns have a slightly more developed case structure with 3 cases

&amp;#x200B;

||Nominative|Oblique|Genitive/Possessive|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|I|je|me|mi|
|you|tu|te|ti|
|He she|eu ey|lo la|de eu/ey|
|we|nos|nos|notre|
|You (plural/formal)|vos|vos|votre|
|they|eus eys|eus eys|de eus/eys|

&amp;#x200B;

# Verbs

Like its Romance brethren, Britagne has a well developed conjugation with two regular verb paradigms: are and er/ir verbs. Here is an example conjugation in the present indicative tense.

&amp;#x200B;

|Chantare|Present|
|:-|:-|
|Je|Chant|
|tu|chant-s|
|eu/ey|chant-t|
|nos|chant-am|
|vos|chant-ate (induces vowel change)|
|eus/eys|chant-an|

In addition to infected conjugations, Britagne uses periphrastic expressions as well. One unique periphrastic phrase is the Interrogative form of Celtic origin. Here is the interrogative form in use.

    A: t'es chantare?
       2 are sing-INF
    B: ole, je chant.
       yes   1 sing

Using the verb for to be, eser, with a verb infinitive, Britagne creates a construction similar to the ""do"" auxiliary verb in English.

&amp;#x200B;

# Lore

As mentioned in the intro, Britagne is primarily spoken in two areas. The first area, southern England, is its original homeland, but in recent years has become nearly extinct in the area due to English prestige. Fortunately, efforts have been made to restore the language in recent years through re-education programs. The second area, the Southern Appalachian mountains, is the largest in terms of speakers of the language. It came to the region in two wave: a smaller wave during the original colonization of the Americas by England, and again with a much larger influx during the 19th and 20th centuries. In the isolated Appalachian mountains, the language thrived and has become the secondary language of many southern states.

Looking at syllable structure in a conlang I’ve been working on for a while, the syllable structure is mostly CCVC, where the second onset consonant can only be an approximants (l, ɹ, or j)… except when the lead consonant is /s/.

*S* so far has never been followed by an approximant, but has been followed by unvoiced plosives (sp, sk, or st) or labial fricatives (sf, sv, or sʍ). It’s the only letter not playing nice with the rules that I have found. Interestingly, the voiced counterpart z hasn’t been followed by anything yet in a coda, and the post-alveolar fricatives (ʃ &amp; ʒ) are in the conlang and they follow the rule of only pairing with approximants (I’ve used ʃl &amp; ʒj so far).

I guess my question is, is this normal? Do natural languages do this?  Where they can be modeled one way, but for a general exception?

""Richard and I used to relax on that hill. We would eat sugar-crosses and watch the tree-gliding pandas"".

Now I can explain a few of the words I chose!

Rixard was the name of a very famous ancient hero in some surviving northern sagas. It's essentially like being named Beowulf, or Leif, or Gilgamesh.

Sugar crosses are small florets of a lettuce-like plant (known as a ""cross"" because of its four big leaves) which are then prepared kind of like toffee apples, and sprinkled with cinnamon and jam sugar. They're a tasty homemade snack in the Euluska homeland.

Lastly, tree-gliding pandas are tiny panda bears that live in trees, with skin flaps like flying squirrels, and they use these to glide between woodland.

1044,0,"Today I wanted to share the participle system in Kaweroi, which is an extremely important aspect of Kaweroi grammar. Participles are used in practically every complex sentence in Kaweroi and are an integral part of verbal grammar. 

All verbs have a maximum of 4 participle forms: present active, past active, present passive, and past passive. Intransitive verbs don't have passive participles. Participle forms cause euphonic variation in the final consonants of the roots of verbs.

||Present|Past|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Active|**-iega/-yega**|**-niega**|
|Passive|**-daga**|**-ndaga/-nedaga**|

&amp;#x200B;

***pet*** ""to bring"": ***pediega, pendiega, pettaga, pendedaga***

***adá*** ""to drink"": ***adáyega, adániega, adádaga, adándaga***

***yake*** ""to break"": ***yakéga, yakeniega, yakedaga, yakendaga***

***notsik*** ""to drop"": ***notsigiega, notsingiega, notsikkada, notsingedaga***

Some irregular verbs have irregular participles:

***mi*** ""to give"": ***miega******, miniega, miedaga, miendaga*** (*i* ""to be"" and *ki* ""to put"" follow the same pattern)

***no*** ""to come"": ***noyega, aniega***

***koe*** ""to say"": ***ko******é******ga, wicht******é******ga, koedaga, wichtedaga*** 

***na*** ""to fall"": ***nayega, n******éga***

***gó*** ""to do"": ***góyega, honiega, gódaga, hondaga***

***wáe*** ""to die"": ***w******áyega, ahondiega***

# Uses for Participles

**#1 : Adjectives**

The first way to use participles in Kaweroi are as adjectives. Like all adjectives, they follow the noun they modify. 

*kiwa* ***koniega*** *ko chitakwih* ""the man going to the store"" 

*shén* ***oriyega*** ""the burning houses""

The past active participle doesn't exactly have an equivalent in English, but roughly translates as ""having Xed"" or ""who Xed""

*chigon* ***miniega*** *koetenowi ókíchitane* ""the woman who gave the speech left""

The present passive participle means ""being Xed"" or ""who is Xed""

*hegíbane ojitawi* ***tsarádaga*** ""I found the missing book"" lit. ""the being lost book""

Lastly, the past passive participle used basically the same as the English past participle.

*rasshinin* ***yakendaga*** ""a broken computer""

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 : Adverbials**

The second way participles are used are in conjunction with interrogatives or prepositions to form adverbial meanings (while, because of, after etc.).

|Preposition|Meaning|Example|
|:-|:-|:-|
|***e +*** **present** |and X|*hekonne chitakwiteh* ***e méga*** *ije* ""I went to the store and bought some fruit""|
|***ni +*** **present** |when X, while X|*hené* ***ni meotiega*** ""I fell while running""|
|***ko*** **+ present** |in order to X, for the purpose of X|*hekonne chitakwiteh* ***ko méga*** *ije* ""I went to the store in order to buy fruit""|
|***mo*** \+ **present** |from X, due to X (indicates means or uncontrollable action)|*hené* ***mo meotiega*** ""I fell because I was running""|
|***wa*** **+ present** |because of X, since X (indicates reason or controllable action)|*hemeonte ko shé* ***wa*** ***ayega*** *kwinaw* ""I ran home because it was raining""|
|***wita*** **+** **present** |after X|*hekabenne* ***wita noyega*** *ko shé* ""I ate after I got home""|
|***gara +*** **present** |before X|*mí kitsiweh meno* ***gara ókíchitayega*** ""Feed the cat before you leave""|
|***eman*** **+ present** |without X|*hókíchita* ***eman kabeniega*** ""I left without eating""|

These are just the most common prepositions used to form adverbial modifiers with participles.

The use of participles as adverbials separate from adjectives also eliminates the ambiguity of ""dangling participles"". For example, in the sentence ""I found them hiding under the bed"", it is unclear whether the subject ""I"" was hiding under the bed, or ""they"" were hiding under the bed. In Kaweroi, these two meanings are represented with two different sentences:

*hegíbanegi tsegodaga pa heltomit* ""I found them, (they) were hiding under the bed""

*hegíbanegi ni tsegodaga pa heltomit* ""I found them while hiding under the beg""

&amp;#x200B;

**#3: Verbal Nouns**

The third way participles can be used is as verbal nouns. Since nouns and adjectives are the same lexical class in Kaweroi, the present active or passive participle can be used as a verbal noun without any modification. 

***ogiega*** *ohowatsse* ""I enjoy swimming"" lit. ""swimming pleases me""

Since they are nouns, verbal nouns can take the locative ending.

*henaikon ehoah* ***tohediegaweh*** ""I need to go **to a meeting** today""

Verbal nouns are also used in many common periphrastic constructions.

***noyega*** *oga wi eitta (hen chi)* ""We would like you to come"".  The last part can be dropped if the subject is obvious from context.

***noyega*** *oga ojihowatsachi* ""We would be pleased if you came"" (very polite way to say ""want"")

As alluded to by the above examples, the verbal noun is also used when making polite commands.

***dayega*** *ojihowattse* ""please sit"", often colloquially shortened to *dayegoji.* This process of turning the present participle ending *-(i/y)ega* into *-(i/y)egoji* has become so productive in many places that it is being grammaticalized into a polite imperative.

&amp;#x200B;

**#4: Auxilliary Verb Constructions**

Verbal nouns are often used in auxilliary verb constructions, of which some common ones are shown below:

**i + verbal noun:** Continuative aspect

*hi koniega ko chitakwih* ""I'm going to the store""

**wanih + verbal noun:** ""Try to X""

*hewaninke noyega ko shé chiett* ""I tried to come home quickly""

**saga + verbal noun:** ""Accidentally Xed, regret X""

*hesaga yakéga palto* ""I accidentally broke the plate""

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, there are a lot of uses for participles/verbal nouns in Kaweroi, and I'm always looking for more ways to use them. I'd be interested to hear how other people use participles or other non-finite verb forms in their conlangs.",Importance of Participles in Kaweroi,"Today I wanted to share the participle system in Kaweroi, which is an extremely important aspect of Kaweroi grammar.

1050,0,"There seems to be a correlation between languages which have huge vowel systems, and languages that have lots of unstressed vowel reduction (e.g., English). And this makes sense if you look at it as conserving functional load--if you reduce a bunch of vowels, you want to have as many options as possible for the one or two unstressed vowels per word.

So, suppose we want to do that on purpose, and we have morphological processes that move the stress around. Ideally, having heard a single form of a word, what the vowel should be if you shift the stress around to other positions should be completely predictable (which it is not in English).

The most straightforward way to do that would be to have only a single type of reduced vowel (so, everything collapses to schwa), and a single stressed vowel phoneme assigned to the word--you can move it around to different syllables, but it's always the same.

But, through the magic of autosegmental phonology, we can do better! The next obvious thing to try is a mixed stress-tone system, where reduced vowels preserve a variety of vowel qualities but only the stressed vowel has distinctive tone. But, is it really vowel reduction if all of the qualities are perfectly preserved?

So, the final approach: unstressed vowels are underspecified in some articulatory feature, which is specified as a suprasegmental feature attached to the stress, but retain some orthogonal feature so they are not all the same, and can influence what happens when they take stress. Could be backness, height, rounding, or whatever. Consider, for example, a system where all vowels reduce to ɛ, ə, ʊ--preserving backness, but neutralizing height. If there are 4 vowel heights specified by a suprasegmental feature, then moving the stress around could, for example, turn ɛ into i, e, stressed ɛ, and æ, turn ə into ɨ, ɘ, ɜ, and ɐ, and turn ʊ into u, o, ɔ, and ɑ, and you get a total of 15 vowels (12 stressed, 3 unstressed).

Working out the formal semantics of Tlaconac has got me thinking about revisiting loglangs, and in particular the problem of the Ergonomic Loglang. And I also find myself fascinated by the phonologies of Ryukyuan language of late, so I figured I might as well squish those two things together!

The obvious name for an ERgonomic logLANG is, of course, ErLang. At least, obvious *to me*... Unfortunately, that name is already taken (  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang\_(programming\_language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)) ), so this one shall be called Erlog instead. The most striking feature of Ryukyuan phonologies for me so far is their remarkably *vertical* consonant inventories, making maximal use of the alveolar place of articulation, giving /t/, /d/, /s/, /z/, /n/, and /ɾ/, romanized straightforwardly as &lt;t&gt;, &lt;d&gt;, &lt;s&gt;, &lt;z&gt;, &lt;n&gt;, and &lt;r&gt;. There ought to be an affricate or two in there as well, but I felt like using palatalization, and we need to get an &lt;l&gt; in there for the name, so we're gonna shift the affricates and &lt;l&gt; over into a parallel palatalized series: /t͡ʃ/, /d͡ʒ/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /ɲ/, /ʎ/, romanized as &lt;tj&gt;, &lt;dj&gt;, &lt;sj&gt;, &lt;zj&gt;, &lt;nj&gt;, and &lt;l&gt;.

That should be plenty of consonants, but I want a /h/ in there as well, and we need &lt;g&gt; for the name. So, the nice perfect columns get augmented with /k/, and /h/; with only one velar stop, voicing isn't phonemic, so I can just as well romanize it with &lt;g&gt;.

Now, we need an &lt;e&gt; and an &lt;o&gt; for the name... but neither of those are pronounced like their IPA equivalents. So, why not go for a vertical vowel system to match the mostly-vertical consonant system?

/ɨ/ - &lt;i&gt;  
/ə/ - &lt;e&gt;  
/ä/ - &lt;o&gt;

And for a smidgen of allophony, we'll have all of those move back after /k/, producing \[ɯ\], \[ɤ̞\], and \[ɑ\], respectively.

Syllable structure is (C)V(C), with no restrictions--but coda /ɾ/ gives r-coloring to the preceding vowel, and coda /h/ results in a voiceless or breathy-voiced vowel.

Geminates can occur across syllable boundaries; /ɾɾ/ becomes \[r\], but all other cases of gemination are unremarkable.

Now, I need some morphonological process which can justify identifying &lt;r&gt; and &lt;l&gt; as a plain / palatalized pair, beyond just needing something to fill out the right number of matching spaces in the non-palatal column, and that's really the only thing that is going to save this from being an \*entirely\* boring phonology that's really just a phonemic inventory. So, a twist: there aren't *actually* two series of phonemic consonants--actually, there's two series of vowels (plain and iotized), which induce allophonic variation in their preceding consonants! This suggests that all coda consonants will actually be plain.

The iotized vowels are realized as \[i\], \[jə\], and \[jä\], respectively (except where the \[j\] merges into a preceding consonant). /k/ and /h/ do not vary with the following vowel, but all other consonants do, so morphological processes that place different types of vowels after an /L/ phoneme will see it realized as either the tap or the lateral approximant.

The ""native"" pronunciation of the name thus turns out to be \[ɚʎäk\].

Even this much of a phonology is probably way overkill for a loglang... but any language needs *some* phonology, so I had fun screwing with Ryukyuan. If I somehow manage to actually whip out the perfect ergonomic loglang in the end, the grammar can always be reskinned. :)

But wait, there's more! With all this iotization and palatalization going on, this language is practically begging to be written in Cyrillic! A possible scheme for that is as follows:

/t/ - Т  
/d/ - Д  
/s/ - С  
/z/ - З  
/n/ - Н  
/ɾ/ - Р  
/ʎ/ -Л  
/k/ - К

/ɨ/ - Ы... or maybe У, because capital yery is kinda weird.  
/ə/ - Э  
/ä/ - А  
/i/ - И  
/jə/ - Е  
/jä/ - Я

Each character ""space"" is actually two overlaid on top over each other. Either a 'consonant' with a 'vowel', or the other way around. If there's a vowel first, however, there is a diacritic mark added below the vowel to denote it comes first. I'm confused as to how to do this part. I'm also confused as to how to keep this pairing strictly to that. Say, with the word ""and"", it would be (vowel + consonant w/ diacritic) (an + d), but with ""sand"" it would be (consonant + vowel, consonant, consonant) (sa + n + d). Consonants never overlap, and vowels never overlap.

Also, is there any (possibly easy) way to look forward and backwards in a set to change the glyph possibly see two or three characters ahead to determine what a glyph should change to? I've tried using the contextual alternatives, but it seems that only goes one back and in front, and as I previously stated, I'm basing this on IPA sets, so almost everything is one or two characters in themselves, maybe three in a rare case. Some glyphs might be represented by five or six sets of characters. One glyph as it is can be represented by eɪ, ɜr, ər, əˌr, or ə depending.

Stress marks ˈ and ˌ in front of consonants, and for the most part ː behind vowels, would be ignored and produce the glyph like it wasn't there, however, it might change a vowel to a diacritic version according to the previous placement.

Is all of this even possible, or am I chasing a pipe dream? I'm unaware of how to use scripts, I'm lost when it comes to those.

In my last post, I showed you the paper, which I wrote describing the process of making an auxiliary language by the name of te munwa lengwa. This time I want to focus on te munwa lengwa's phonology and word creation process and show you how it works. I also translated the lexicon into english, so you can take a better look at it now.

**Phoneme Inventory**

|Affricate||t͡ʃ &lt;c&gt; d͡ʒ &lt;j&gt;||||
|Nasal|m|n||||
|Fricative|f|s ʃ &lt;x&gt;|||h|
|Approximant|(w)|l|j &lt;y&gt;|w||
|Trill||r||||

There are five vowels: /a, e, i, o ,u/, possible diphthongs are /ai, au, ei, eu, oi, ou, ia, ua, ie, ue, io, iu/. The falling diphthongs /ia, ua, ie, ue, io, iu/ can also be thought of as sequences of semivowels and vowels /ja, wa, je, we, jo, ju/. In words derived from spanish and/or english like f.e. ""naxion"", I preferred spelling them as diphthongs to preserve their original spelling. 

**Allophones**

This conlang is an auxiliary language based on english, spanish, mandarin and hindi. That means that two sounds can be in free variation, as long as none of these four languages make a phonemic distinction between the two, so alveolar /t, d, n/ can also be dental, but not retroflex, since hindi differentiates alveolar from retroflex plosives and nasals. similar to that

* /t͡ʃ/ can be pronounced as \[t͡ɕ\], but not as \[ʈ͡ʂ\]
* /ʃ/ can be pronounced as \[ɕ\], but not as \[ʂ\] (or \[ʒ\])
* /h/ can be pronounced as \[x\], since /x/ is only a marginal phoneme in Hindi
* /w/ can be pronounced as \[ʋ\], but not as \[v\], because the distinction between /w/ and /v/ is phonemic in english and spanish

The voiceless plosives and affricates should be pronounced with a strong aspiration. This serves to accentuate the distinction between voiced and voiceless stops for mandarin speakers, who are used to an aspirated - unaspirated distinction. This also means, that the voiced plosives and affricates can also be voiceless, as long as their voiceless counterparts are aspirated.

\[ɹ\] is a viable approximation for the /r/ sound, since none of the four languages makes that exact distinction.

/n/ can be /m/ or /ŋ/, depending on the place of articulation of the following consonant. If the sequence /ng/ occurs at the end of a word, it turns to /ŋ/, like in the word ""nareng"", meaning orange, as opposed to ""lengwa"", language, which is realized as /leŋ.gwa/.

Regarding vowels, variation between close-mid /e, o/ and /ɛ, ɔ/ should be avoided, whereas variation between close /i, u/ and near-close /ɪ, ʊ/ can be allowed, since in english and hindi this distinction is not only marked by vowel quality but also by length.

Falling diphthongs may also be pronounced as two separate syllables to ease pronunciation, so ""februeri"" may also be pronounced as /feb.ru.e.ri/.

**Phonotactics**

Consonant clusters of more than two consonants are avoided in word creation. If there is a word with such a cluster, that is exactly the same in multiple languages and therefore has to be included, the cluster is broken up by inserting a vowel, so that that vowel is identical to the following vowel in the word. F.e. the word ""skrin"", screen, is broken up by adding an i vowel and turns to ""skirin""

There is an exception to this rule for mandarin words with the initial /tsʰ/ or /ts/ followed by a semivowel, like 最. 

**Word creation**

In te munwa lengwa new words are added through a system, where the words of the source languages are compared and a new word is made according to their similarities. For each language, a word is listed in the original spelling in the source language and then converted to the phonemes of te munwa lengwa according to the table in the lexicon doc. This can be very easy, like in the case of the word ""internet"":

EN: internet: internet

SP: internet: internet

HI: इंटरनेट: internet

MA: 互联网 hùliánwǎng: hulyenwang

similarities: internet &gt;**internet**

If there aren't any identical words, the similarities can be made into a new word, that resembles the words in all four languages in some aspect, like with the word ""bida"":

EN: big: big

SP: grande: grande

HI: अभिमानी: abimani, बडा: beda

MA: 大 dà: da, 伟大 wěidà: weida

similarities: big/beda/abi, beda/weida &gt;**bida**

If there are neither any identical words, nor any similarities at all, then the mandarin word is borrowed directly, like with the word ""inwei"":

EN: because: bikos, since: sins 

SP: porque: porke

HI: क्योंकि: kyonki

MA: 因为 yīnwèi: inwei

similarities: - &gt;**inwei**

This rule serves to give mandarin more influence, since english, spanish and hindi are related and therefore are going to have more words in common with each other than with mandarin.

1068,0,"So I wanted to say and ask a couple of questions around etiquette with regards to Conlang, and I think the best way to do this is to start with an explanation of what I am trying to do.

Question One:

I have a language, an extinct but incredibly well-studied language (not Latin); and it has around 4500 known words; the issue is that for my needs it doesn't have more contemporaneous words, it is limited to its 4500 ish words which went extinct around 2,500 years ago. (If you can guess the language you is a clever bunny).

We know (apparently) a lot of the language's grammar, phonology etc.

Now I am working with Vulgarlang, I would like to add new words and keep the original words, and make some changes - essentially creating a modern version of the language, but for my purposes, a fictional environment, though unlike the original language, written in the Latin alphabet; is that kind of thing frowned upon in Conlang circles?

Question Two:

I have another language, an existent language, is it okay to create a new language based on exactly the same phonology and grammar rules, but obviously randomly generated (using Vulgarlang again) and thus not the 'same' as the original language - is this frowned upon in Conlang circles?

Question Three:

I have two languages that are well known, is it okay to combine their rules \[grammar and phonology\] and create a new derivative language?

Final thought:

I am not very good at grammar or languages, so I started trying manually and then purchased Vulgarlang as I wanted a certain amount of automation, and have found myself getting sucked into trying to build the six languages I need for a story rather than writing the story. I was about 45k words into the story before someone suggested I should conlang rather than 'borrow' from existent languages, and because I know so little about languages (I also bought that book on building a conlang from scratch, and subscribed to the podcast and watched a dozen youtube tutorials, so I have come to understand some stuff, but it's so time-consuming... which I think is great as a hobby, but this isn't really 'my' hobby (I think people who do this are amazing, so talented, I am not in this department); and I just want to tell my story. So I want to know what the Conlang etiquette is so I  do quick and dirty Conlanging, without offending or upsetting anyone or any community.  


My wordsmithery here is probably not the best, but I hope you understand I am attempting to quickly understand and not offend.",Is there such thing as Conlang Etiquette?,"So I wanted to say and ask a couple of questions around etiquette with regards to Conlang, and I think the best way to do this is to start with an explanation of what I am trying to do.

1075,0,"Me and a decent group of people are reviving and remaking a slave can't-language that was previously just a remodel of English letters. (Ex. apple --&gt; aypupului). However, as our dictionary progresses, I fear it's just becoming an English relex. We do have some grammatical features, for example:

""I am going for a walk"" turns into

""Ay pe'jæšgo gše tfuwek"" which is roughly, ""I am going for walk""

The ""pe"" prefix changes verbs to present tense (šna meaning go).  We also have verb suffixes, where if the verb ends in a consonant you add the verb + o + a suffix. -Opyu means -able, so to turn ""vuwek"" (love) into ""loveable"" it would become vuwekoyu. Our current suffixes are yu (able) and oš (-en).

While I am fond of the current grammatical system in place, I want it to have more quirks and different concepts, especially because this is a recreation of a slave language and having it entirely based from English (besides word translations which stem from Swahili and Igbo) almost seems disrespectful in a way. None of us in the group are multilingual while also being knowledgeable in our native languages grammar as far as I know, which makes it harder.

At the moment, our dictionary has a few ""untranslatable"" words (for example, eljæš meaning ""When you recognize that you're making a memory right now, and it is one that you may or may not remember in the future""), but besides that all of our words written are just translations of English words with our own root words ( baby and child are *epu*i and *epu*ne, as another example).

 I want the language to become more complex, but it's hard to complete that when you have a group of people creating it who may not all understand implementing subjects like new grammar and understanding it, and another group of people wanting to learn the language but are already nervous at the site of different grammar and words.

So about a year ago I started working on an international auxiliary language and a paper describing the process of making it. Now that the paper has been finally graded i decided to share this conlang with you. [This google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ip6QYuSjky5Ba5NPibi4kilb4o-J5eNT_dB3WwdC5s4/edit?usp=sharing) contains the whole paper. In summary; to make te munwa lengwa a truly international language I tried to specifically solve some problems with it that eperanto suffers from. I also tried to make it as similar as possible to the four world's most spoken languages: English, spanish, mandarin and hindi. At the end of the paper there is an esperanto text which I translated to te munwa lengwa.

The paper is in german however and it is also very much focused on how the features of the language came to be. So to properly show you this conlang, in the next few weeks, I will do a series of posts describing te munwa lengwa in english and from a learner's perspective. I will post an english version of the lexicon too, as well as a list containing the process of how I came up with the words in that lexicon. The lexicon and the word origins are also available in the paper.

If you speak spanish, mandarin and hindi natively, I would be happy if you could maybe read through the list of word origins and point out any obvious mistakes or words that i misused. I don't speak any of those three languages, so I relied on the internet as well as complicated reference grammars for my research and there will probably be some errors.

---

So... the actual definition is actually incredibly vague and subjective, and not very helpful. To quote Wikipedia, at least:

&gt; When a given word class is subject to inflection in a particular language, there are generally one or more standard patterns of inflection (the paradigms described below) that words in that class may follow. Words which follow such a standard pattern are said to be regular; those that inflect differently are called irregular.

In other words, if it behaves normally, it's regular, if it doesn't, it's irregular.

However, there's a concept in Latin and Greek verbs, which frequently gets extended to other languages and even other word classes, call the principal parts of an inflection. Essentially, the principal parts of an inflection are a minimal set of forms which the rest of the inflection can be derived from. I'll use Old English verbs as an example, since I'm a bit more comfortable with those than with Latin and Greek. (Also, the verbs have few enough forms that I can reasonably include virtually the entire paradigm)

For weak verbs, you really only need the infinitive and the 1S past. You could mostly get away with the infinitive, but the 1S past serves three main purposes. 1) The presence of a dental informs you it's definitely weak, 2) you can distinguish between class 1 (-ede) and class 2 (-ode), and 3) if it experiences rückumlaut like ""sēċan, sōhte"" (&gt;seek, sought), you also get the unmutated vowel. Meanwhile, you need a few more forms for strong verbs. You also need to add the singular past subjunctive (or really any past form besides 1S and 3S indicative) and the past participle, so you have one form for every ablauted form. As a minimal inflectional pair, where infinitive + 1S past is insufficient, ""wrecan, wræc"" (&gt;wreak, wreaked) has past participle ""ġewr**e**can"", but ""brecan, bræc"" (&gt;break, broke) has past participle ""ġebr**o**cen"". Thus, if you wanted to give Latin-style principal parts for an Old English verb, a weak verb would look like ""lufian, lufode, lufode, ġelufod"" (&gt;love), while a strong verb would look like ""brecan, bræc, brǣce, ġebrocen"". And, because they act like a hybrid, a rückumlauting verb would look like ""sēċan, sōhte, sōhte, ġesōht""

With this in mind, we can give a more precise definition of irregular.

&gt; If the principal parts are some subset of the inflected forms which are normally sufficient to ""finish out"" an inflection, irregular inflections are the exceptions

Continuing my Old English example, if the principal parts are the infinitive, 1S past indicative, singular past subjunctive, and the past participle, there are three main groups of verbs which are still irregular- the preterite-presents, the class 3 weak verbs, and the ""anomalous verbs"". Giving an example of the first two, ""habban"" (&gt; have) is a class 3 weak verb whose other principal parts are hæfde, hæbbe, and ġehæfd, and ""cunnan"" (&gt; can) is a preterite-present whose other principal parts are cūðe, cūðe, and ġecunnen. If I were trying to guess the inflections, it'd probably look something like this: (bolded forms are incorrect)

||habban, present|habban, past|cunnan, present|cunnan, past|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|1S Ind|**habbe**|hæfde|**cunne**|cūðe|
|2S Ind|**habbest**|hæfdest|**cunnest**|cūðest|
|3S Ind|**habbeð**|hæfde|**cunneð**|cūðe|
|P Ind|habbað|hæfdon|**cunnað**|cūðon|
|S Subj|**habbe**|hæfde|cunne|cūðe|
|P Subj|**habben**|hæfden|cunnen|cūðen|
|Part|**habbende**|ġehæfd|cunnende|ġecunnen|

In reality, habban changes the stem vowel to æ in most present forms, though the endings are otherwise correct, and cunnan, as a preterite-present, conjugates like a strong past verb in the present, with cann, canst, cann, cunnon. (Noting that even *that's* irregular, since 2S used the 1S vowel) Then the anomalous verbs, which are the completely irregular ones, are even stranger. As two examples, wesan (&gt; parts of ""to be""), which is mostly a regular class 5 strong verb, but with a suppletive present, and gān (&gt; go), which is mostly a regular class 7 strong verb, but with a suppletive (but otherwise regular!) past

So what's the point of all this? 

Well first of all, it means that some things commonly called irregular verbs straight up just *aren't*. For example, a lot of Romance languages have a group of verbs with orthographic changes before certain endings, like proteger &gt; protejo in Spanish. Phonologically, it's completely regular, with /prote'xer/ becoming /pro'texo/. It just requires a spelling change, because &lt;protego&gt; would be pronounced /~go/. You can predict the change entirely from the fact that the infinitive ends in -ger, so you don't need to mess with the definition of a principal part. Contrast with breaking verbs, like poder &gt; puedo, which *are* irregular. There's no synchronic reason, just looking at the infinitives, that volar should become vuelo, but acolar should become acolo.

Second, it means that irregular verbs don't have to be unique in their irregularities. Depending on the origin of the irregularities, it's entirely possible for there to be entire groups of verbs with the *same* irregularity. Continuing the Spanish example, it has two classes of stem-vowel changes which can happen (and can co-occur)- diphthongization and vowel raising. These are actually so well defined that *if* you know a verb undergoes diphthongization or vowel raising, you can predict exactly what stem change will happen and which forms it will happen in. Diphthongization, for example, results in a change from &lt;o&gt; to &lt;ue&gt; or &lt;e&gt; to &lt;ie&gt; specifically in any forms where the stem vowel is stressed. You just can't tell from the infinitive alone whether a verb will undergo one of these changes.

And third, it means that irregularities don't have to be completely paradigmatic. *Some* verbs have completely irregular conjugations, like ""to be"" in a lot of Indo-European languages, but other times, it's just an irregular stem that forms are otherwise regularly derived from. For example, ""ēode"" is irregular as the past tense of ""gān"", but it otherwise behaves like a regular weak past. 1S = 3S = PAST-e, 2S = PAST-est, Pl = PAST-on, etc. The Latin 1st conjugation provides another interesting example of this. The vast majority of them form the 1S perfect with -āvī, to the point that you'll frequently see it called *the* 1st conjugation perfect ending, but a handful have other perfect endings, like crepō, crepuī. (But then go on to use the normal endings to derive the rest of the perfect from it) As one last example, ある in Japanese actually mostly behaves like a normal consonant-stem verb, but instead of using ない as an auxiliary verb(al adjective) to form the negative as \*あらない, it uses ない itself as a suppletive negative. (Also on the topic of Japanese, 死ぬ stands out as the only consonant-stem verb whose stem ends in -n, but at least in Modern Japanese, it's otherwise completely regular. It's just a bit of an oddity)

So if you want to introduce irregular inflections to your conlang, but are put off by the prospect of making something as different as ""to be"" in English, don't be. Not only is it naturalistic to have ""less"" irregular inflections, they're arguably *more* common than ""completely"" irregular inflections. Your irregular inflections can be as simple as some set of words using a different ending. For example, [Biblaridion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnvpejRsQ2Y) has an excellent video on how irregularities *form*, where he creates a sketchlang with 3 verb conjugations. The A-conjugation either ends in a consonant or -CCa, and adds -(a)l in the perfect, the U-conjugation ends in -C or -CCu and adds -(u)l, and the I-conjugation ends in -C or -CCi and adds -(i)l. In other words, the perfect ending is -l, and there's a thematic a, u, or i which disappears after a single consonant in the simple aspect, but resurfaces in the perfect. However, there's a 4th irregular conjugation where some verbs ending in -n add -du instead. Or if you want to get *really* elaborate, instead of having the same stem be used to derive the perfective and imperfective of a verb, you can come up with two separate verbs that get used as each other's perfective/imperfective. Hopping back to natlangs for a moment, we see this pattern in, among other languages, Old English, where bēon lacked a past tense and just used wesan's, and Polish, where widzieć is ""to see, impf"", but the unrelated zobaczyć is ""to see, perf"".",Irregularity and Principal Parts,"I was inspired by yesterday's thread about irregular copulas to write this resource on what irregularity actually *is*, and how it can show up in a conlang

Now that I’ve reached the **1.000** word threshold, I thought I would celebrate this achievement by sharing an interesting piece of Rekja anti’s grammar, its noun composition system and the important role that noun classifiers play in it.

To understand how composition works, we first have to briefly talk about the classifiers. So here we go:

# Classifiers

Rekja anti’s classifiers are bound morphemes that can be attached onto roots to derive nouns of different classes/genders. The six classifiers are:

1. The human classifier, -*go(m)*, which makes nouns to refer to humans, but also to deities and personifications.
2. The animal classifier, -*s(u)*, for animals.
3. The classifier for body parts, -*u*.
4. The one for natural things, objects and places, -*a(n)*
5. The one for artificial and countable abstract things, -*ja*/-*ā*
6. And the one for uncountable abstract concepts and mass nouns, -*is*.

Each of these classifiers can be attached to an existing root (usually a verb root) to both nominalise it and assign it to a class (which is crucial to determining the resulting meaning of the noun). Every noun has a classifier which cannot be removed. Classifiers are thus both nominalisers and class markers.

Now that we have talked about them, it is time to focus on the main topic of this post:

# Noun composition

Although not very productive, composition is still one method in Rekja anti to derive new words. It is also important to mention that Rekja anti is a heavily head-initial language, so complementisers usually go after that which they complement.

With verbs, it is quite simple, you simply attach both roots, and bam, you have got a new verb. But with nouns it is more complicated. As stated above, a noun cannot have its classifier removed, as it is an essential part of the noun.

Also, when making a composite noun, the resulting compositum has to be of the same class as the head noun, so when we combine two nouns, we expect that the resulting compositum to have the same ending (classifier) as its head noun. When both nouns share the same class (and therefore ending) this is not a problem, for this example we will take two nouns of the 4th class (see above section on classifiers; the stem of the noun is marked in the examples with italics, to contrast it from the classifier, written normally; the head noun is shown in bold to later show better the class agreement):

***tis*****an** (""side"", ""shore"") + *gēl*ōn (""river"") = ***tis*****ā***gēl*ōn (""river shore"")

The underlying structure can be represented as the following:

**\[nounA.class4\]** \+ \[nounB.class4\]               |         *tisan* \+ *gēlōn*

= \[**\[nounA.class4\]**\[nounB.class4\]\_\]            |         *tisāgēlōn*

The lowbar **\_** marks an empty spot where the classifier of the compositum goes. If it is left empty like that, it is assumed that class4 of nounB  carries over and, because that matches the gender of the head, we leave it like that, unmarked.

This is a problem, however, when we have two nouns of different classes, in this case to exemplify, classes 5 and 6:

**\[nounA.class6\]** \+ \[nounB.class5\]

= \* \[**\[nounA.class6\]**\[nounB.class5\]\_\]

e.g.

*gam*is (""food"") + *hosk*ā (""night"", ""evening"") 

= \* ***gam*****is***sosk*ā

If we were to leave it like that, unmarked, class5 would carry over, but then the gender of the compositum wouldn't match with the gender of the head, that is class6. So, we cannot leave it like that. We also cannot substitute class5 for class6 in nounB, because that would change the meaning of nounB.

To break the automatical “carry over” of class5, we have to explicitly express the classifier of the head, in this case class6, in the empty space, so we end up with the following structure:

\[**\[nounA.class6\]**\[nounB.class5\]**class6**\]

***gam*****is***sosk*ā**s** (""dinner"") --&gt; word #1000 in Rekja anti's lexicon

We basically added the classifier -*is* to *gamissoskā*, which gives *gamissoskās* (A short vowel following a long vowel is deleted).

&amp;#x200B;

So, that's all, basically.

## [Playing with Language: Three Language Games in the Gulf of Guinea (Agostinho &amp; de Araujo)](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/24974/agostinho__araujo.pdf) 
    
This week's paper was submitted by fellow mod u/roipoiboy and discusses language games in the gulf of Guinea. While this is not really a typological paper, it'll definitely be nice inspiration for all you conlangers out there! Language games are ""the result of a transformation or series of transformations acting regularly on an ordinary language text, with the intent of altering the form but not the content of the original message, for purposes of concealment or comic effect"". You might be familiar with Pig Latin: that is a language game in English! Now it's your turn. Let's move onto the prompts:

* Does your language have language games?
    * How do they work? How do they manifest in everyday life?
    * What are the phonological processes that produce the game's surface forms?
    * In what social contexts does the game appear? Is it exclusively spoken by children?
* What are some other interesting speech types in your language? Any genderlects, or maybe animal speech?

1125,0,"**Milës** is a collaborative language that aims to develop naturally without permanent rules, and from the suggestions of our members. So far, we’ve developed a basic vocabulary of 48 words and 11 verbs, as well as some general phrases.

We’re looking to create:

* an aesthetically pleasing language with few vowel distinctions and simple phonotactics.
* a conlang favoring richness and freedom of communication over regularity and rulesets.
* A group using consensus-based decision-making to resolve disagreements together.

What grammar we have as of now consists follows a VSO word order, with a special rule indicating “and/again” via repetition of a word. Here are two phrases demonstrating this rule:

&gt;matala	ko	ko	aya	Milës.   
speak	you	you	I	Milës.

'you and I talk about Milës.'

&gt;aya	kon	        kon .  
i	arrive	arrive.

'I arrive again.' This can be shortened to: 'I return.'

Contribution and usage of Milës are completely unregulated; If you’d like to add to it, feel free to join via our [discord](https://discord.gg/Ae8PVsyTYh)!  

This next part is about some of our traditions while developing the conlang.

## Customs

We’ve imagined a bit of a “culture” pertaining to the development of the language. The culture is not meant for a fantasy setting, but rather to be used casually in everyday communication. You don’t need to participate in this if you’d like. However, this part of our post is dedicated to it.

Regarding the naming and creation of each contributor’s role in the language, we have a language-creation myth:

&gt;So very long ago, during gray and overcast days past, Thunder rumbled.

Thunder is Phonology.

&gt;From the shaken sky tumbled Thunder's noises and with them Rain.

Rain is Morphology.

&gt;By the fallen Rain, Flower was nourished and River was filled.

Flower is Semantics, and River is Pragmatics.

&gt;Upon its web, between Flower and Stone, Spider gathered Rain.

Spider is Syntax.

&gt;When Rain ceased and Thunder silenced, Bee gathered Flower's pollen.

Bee is Corpus.

&gt;Bee then flew away to its hive to make our Common Honey.  
&gt;  
&gt;Upon the hive came Bear who so loved our Common Honey that it shared with all who would sample.

Bear is Pedagogy.

&gt;Witnessing all this, from atop Stone, Bird declared, ""May this recur until all our tribe partakes of Common Honey (Milës).""

As you can see, each figure (bear, stone, etc.) in the story prelates to a certain fundamental aspect of our language. And from each of their interactions in the poem and our own ideas, we have developed a culture and many taboos.

For example, the stone is seen as odd for unlike the others, it cannot flow or change. The in-culture explanation for syntactic ambiguity is the flower's (meaning) unwillingness to cooperate with the spider (syntax).

There’s still plenty of room for anybody who’d like to help. If you’d like to see (*or* contribute) more, feel free to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/Ae8PVsyTYh) server.

Your language’s phonology must:

* Include **diphthongs** and show how you know that they are distinct from vowel-vowel sequences or from vowels plus a glide consonant.
* Have at least one **phoneme with a limited distribution** where the distribution depends on grammatical rather than purely phonological factors. This could be something like a consonant that's only contrastive in nouns or a vowel that only appears in affixes but never roots, for example.

## Grammar

Your language's grammar must:

* Make use of **root-template morphology**. This can be satisfied by any system where roots which are underspecified for something and combine with a template containing enough specification to make them a full word. Examples might include the consonantal roots you get in Semitic languages or verbs where the stem is a string of segments unspecified for suprasegmental things like timing, stress, and tone.
* Include a class of **discourse markers** which don't change the meaning of the sentence but do relate it to the context which it's spoken in  (i.e. a sentence with a discourse marker is true in all the same circumstances as one without, but it might only make sense to use the discourse marker in certain contexts).
* Mark **evidentiality** in a grammaticalized way, showing the source of the information expressed in a statement.

## Script DLC

Design a script for your conlang! If you design a script, then show how it works in your speedlang documentation, then you can skip one of the above requirements. I'm definitely not doing this to encourage the community to think about script making ahead of a themed issue of a certain conlanging publication. Nope. Definitely not.

## AI Prompts

And last but not least, Med asked me to ask an AI to generate some more prompts. You don't have to actually do these. I'm not sure they all even make sense. But if you do all of them then you'll get super secret surprise bonus points.

* A sentence consisting of an uninflected phrase followed by an adverb indicating tense, where the two elements must have been expressed together in the original.
* Adverbs of manner which do not modify the verb (i.e. “very,” “very much,” “very fast”)
* “Because.”
* Prepositions with no meaning.
* Exclamation points
* Words which convey their own meaning
* Expressions which are true but make no sense.
* Sentences which say what they mean.
* Sentences which are not true.
* Sentences which are false.

Well that started to get a little philosophical towards the end didn't it.

## Tasks

* Document and showcase your language, explaining and demonstrating how it meets all of the elements of the challenge.
* Translate and gloss at least five example sentences. You can either get 'syntax test sentences' by asking Zephyrus`\\texttt{z!stest}` (RIP Leonard) on the Discord server, in which case note down which number sentences you get, or you can pick from recent 'Just Used 5 Minutes of your Day' challenges posted by u/mareck_ here on r/conlangs, in which case note which number 5moyds you do.

### Rules

1) Post a word in your language, with IPA and a definition.

Note: try to show your word inflected, as it would appear in a typical sentence. This can be the source of many interesting borrowings in natlangs (like how so many Arabic words were borrowed with the definite article fossilized onto it! algebra, alcohol, etc.)

2) Respond to a post by adapting the word to your language's phonology, and consider shifting the meaning of the word a bit!

3) Sometimes, you may see an interesting phrase or construction in a language. Instead of adopting the word as a loan word, you are welcome to **calque** the phrase -- for example, taking *skyscraper* by using your language's native words for *sky* and *scraper*. If you do this, please label the post at the start as **Calque** so people don't get confused about your path of adopting/loaning.

1137,0,"I've begun watching season 2 of demon slayer (*Machtegomat o* *Ichao* in Kaweroi) and can't get the opening song out of my head- so I decided to translate it into my conlang like any rational human would do.

Below is the lyrics as well as the English translation and the transcription in *kendi*, Kaweroi's script. Quick history lesson:

Kaweroi is spoken on a continent in the North Pacific Ocean, and first learned to write from Japan in the 1200's, which involved importing thousands of Chinese Characters (kanji) to write. Just like in Japan, these characters were often used to represent syllables, and simplifications of these characters gave rise to many native syllabaries used to write the various languages on the continent. Later in history, Japanese kana were re-introduced to the continent, and Katakana transcription became the standard way to write Kaweroi. The native scripts were relegated to marginal religious and personal use, although they are now making a comeback. Anyways, here's the song:

The language doesnt use traditional sentence structure. Instead it uses 2-3 different types of glyphs in conjunction to create a descriptor, and multiple of these descriptors come together to create a word. There are approximately 30 glyphs in the language and it can be used to describe alot of things. The main problem is the amount of glyphs to make a word can be quite large, but i still found it cool and fun to make nonetheless.

So for a while now I've been doing playthroughs of the game Spore, a game where you guide a species from a single cell to a galactic empire, and for each, I've made small conlangs just to name their buildings and vehicles and stuff. 

I usually decide the phonology based on a combination of their mouth anatomy and the names of the villagers in Tribal stage (Where each of your creatures is given a name). Most mouths are, in my view, perfectly capable of making all the sounds that humans make, since I assume near-identical throat anatomy and such. If they have something like a bird beak, I'll remove lip sounds like /p/, /b/, /m/, /f/, and /v/ since with a birdlike beak, I assume they would be unable to bend their mouths to make these shapes.

But, for my upcoming playthrough, I've decided I want to challenge myself. And so, I am going to be using one of [these four mouths](https://imgur.com/a/eUUEoE2) for my creature. But, I'm having a ton trouble coming up with phonology.

Obviously, with these pincer-like mouths, no labial sounds. However, I'm wondering exactly how far I should go with removing sounds. Usually, I assume near-identical-to-human inner mouth and throat structure, but with this I'm not sure. Obviously they would have tongues, but I'm unsure how much of an inner mouth they should have seeing as most of their chewing seems like it would occur outside of their mouth. So I'm likely going to eliminate any dental sounds. Here's where I struggle...

How far back should I cut back their throats? What regions should they have in their mouth to make sounds? Do the pincers lead directly to the their throat only making only velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal sounds possible?

And then there's the issue of vowels... Now personally, I can make most basic vowel sounds without moving my mouth, so do I include all vowels? Would the pincer mouths limit vowels at all? 

If you made it this far, mul'dan'tus he'ihr for reading this post. This is something I've had on my mind for a while, so, I figured I'd reach out for help.",Need help deciding on the phonology of my next conlang!,"Sal'lo a'na'tohr!

1145,0,"I've been spending the past few days trying to develop a conlang that looks like the first thing that could've constituted a language.

So far, it seems to be an impossible task. There seems to be no way to bridge anything resembling a language with the unorganized babbling of trained chimpanzees. 

In particular, I was trying to avoid abstract concepts, unless they could be connected with something concrete anyway. For instance, the word for 'and' derived from a verb meaning something like 'to accompany'. Accordingly, it also doubles as the comitative adposition. I figured this could be extended to 'but', since its basically the word 'and', but expressed contrast or surprise. A word for 'or' though is problematic. Really, any sort of conjunction seems rarely possible to derive from something material. Time words are also a problem. I've already been forced to make a word for 'always', and was thinking of making a word for 'now', just to make the language work. These are both pretty abstract concepts. I also have a word for 'have', even though the concept of ownership would probably be rather advanced, and not likely to occur with what is basically a bunch of alien homo erectus. 

Honestly, mostly all this project has amount to so far is make me wonder if language really could've developed naturally. I can't imagine anyway it could've arose without something intelligent intervening and just implanting certain vocab and the ability to use language into living beings somehow.

I've honestly been tempted to just give up on all the 'language of the missing link' thing and just go for something highly basic similar to Toki Pona, but highly unoptimized. That was sorta my goal in the first place anyway. Going that route thing, such as giving the language words for 'before', 'after', 'past', 'future', etc... would probably make the thing look little like what I originally envisioned. 

I don't know what to do with this thing, it hardly even seems worthwhile to develop it anymore. As I've said, all its really accomplished is make me think that some intelligence must have intervened in our creation for us to be able to speak at all. Even Noam Chomsky apparently thinks that a 'language organ' just suddenly emerged from a single mutation one day, because even he apparently can't see any intermediate form between animal calls and a true language. 

Personally, I think language may have started off as holo-phrases. They are actually pretty similar to animal calls, minus being made up of actual phonemes. Still though, I can't imagine anyway anything could move on from that. I mean if you have one word for 'eating food', 'want food', 'see food', 'my food', etc... how on earth do you refine that into more specific words? This just seems undoable. I'm a religious none just so we know, but honestly as I've stated twice now, I'm starting to see it as non-sensical that we came from just random mutations without any sort of interference from some form of intelligence. 

Okay, I'm just rambling now. I'm just getting frustrated staring at a blank page for hours on end trying to find some sort of physical item or action that could be repurposed as a word for 'now', 'same', or some other clearly abstract concept.

I'm pretty new to conlanging, and i've recently begun constructing my first attempt - which shall now become a proto-language for a descendant.
However, i've found myself wondering:
If in the proto-language some verb's infinitive form would be ""to can"" (just to demonstrate what i mean) and past tense forms of verbs are formed by adding a -te suffix(so cante) and now phonological change comes around and fronts vowels before word final nasals, making the infinitive form ""to caen"", would the past tense formation inherit the original form cante, as this form is not affected by the change, or would it become caente, because the past tense is now formed by the same process but from a new root?
Are there any patterns for this in natlangs?

1155,0,"So I got distracted... I got a little annoyed that everyone says it is infeasible to make a syllabary for English–and it kind of is (and definitely pointless as you could never remember them all)–but Chinese has some on the range of 20,000 characters so the 15,000-odd English syllables shouldn't be TOO bad. A quick google search, and I found [this link](http://web.archive.org/web/20160822211027/http://semarch.linguistics.fas.nyu.edu/barker/Syllables/index.txt) which claimed to have (almost) all English syllables. Great! I can just do matchy match with their transcriptions right? RIGHT? Nope! They use insane phonemic transcriptions so I decided to take the last hour writing a program (it was mostly dealing with the phonemes) to convert their gibberish to IPA.

I compared their phonemic transcriptions to the (received pronunciation/UK) IPA on wiktionary to get a dictionary of transcriptions to IPA. A few caveats to the ipa:

1. I am American, the list is British, so some of these judgements (of the 1 or 2 that exist) may be inaccurate–I tried my best.
2. Some diphthongs seem to be separate syllables in the example words (especially ""ia""), I left them.

Here was the resulting phoneme dictionary: {'aa': 'ɒ', 'ae': 'æ', 'ah': 'ʌ', 'ao': 'ɔ', 'ao': 'ɔː', 'aw': 'aʊ', 'ax': 'ə', 'ay': 'aɪ', 'ea': 'ɛə', 'eh': 'ɛ', 'er': 'ɜː', 'ey': 'eɪ', 'ia': 'i.ə', 'ih':'ɪ', 'iy': 'iː', 'oh': 'ɒ', 'ow': 'əʊ', 'oy': 'ɔɪ', 'ua': 'ʊə', 'uh': 'ʊ', 'uw': 'uː', 'p': 'p', 'b': 'b', 't': 't', 'd': 'd', 'f': 'f', 'v': 'v', 'th': 'θ', 'dh': 'ð', 's': 's', 'z': 'z', 'sh': 'ʃ', 'zh': 'ʒ', 'ch': 't͡ʃ', 'jh': 'dʒ', 'k': 'k', 'ng': 'ŋ', 'g': 'g', 'm': 'm', 'n': 'n', 'l': 'l', 'r': 'ɹ', 'w': 'w', 'y': 'j', 'hh': 'h'}

Here is a google doc: [English Syllables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igluTEKaLTOsY7v9GMPqBs5Rm3gcw4UbkIXzJk2jYbk/edit?usp=sharing)",Who wanted to know the IPA for all English syllables?,"So I got distracted... I got a little annoyed that everyone says it is infeasible to make a syllabary for English–and it kind of is (and definitely pointless as you could never remember them all)–but Chinese has some on the range of 20,000 characters so the 15,000-odd English syllables shouldn't be TOO bad. A quick google search, and I found [this link](http://web.archive.org/web/20160822211027/http://semarch.linguistics.fas.nyu.edu/barker/Syllables/index.txt) which claimed to have (almost) all English syllables. Great! I can just do matchy match with their transcriptions right? RIGHT? Nope! They use insane phonemic transcriptions so I decided to take the last hour writing a program (it was mostly dealing with the phonemes) to convert their gibberish to IPA.

1177,0,"Been working on a conlang, finally got it advanced enough to write out a paragraph. I noticed a problem though; the words all sound too similar.

The problem is, the conlang only has about 10 consonants and 5 vowels. Worse yet, it only allows CV and V syllables. This all means that assuming most words are only one or two syllables in length, there's only five possible arrangements of vowels and consonants:

V

CV

CVCV

CVV

VCV

Most words are turning out to be CVCV, due to it giving the largest variety. This means a lot of sentences are just CVCV CVCV CVCV CVCV (and yes, I have a number of sentences that look just like that). The limited phoneme inventory isn't helping much either, since it means there's only about 10 possible onsets for all words. 

Is this avoidable? Is there anyway to fix this beyond just altering the phonology to allow more phonemes and syllable types? I would guess it wouldn't be much problem in practice, since supposedly Indonesian suffers from the same problem. Still, its a bit hard to parse sentences in a language you're learning when seeming most of the lexicon is CVCV, which is mostly only being broken by the occasional CV word. Yeah, fml, and minimalism. Thankfully this is a primitese artlang I'm just doing to take a break from my main one, so its usability doesn't matter too much, but having sentences that are hard to parse makes it a bit hard to work on the grammar.",Keeping all words from sounding the same when the phonology is severely limited?,"Been working on a conlang, finally got it advanced enough to write out a paragraph.

1178,0,"I’m interested in creating a conlang, but I’m having trouble starting the process. From what I’ve seen, the most common first step is to decide on a phonemic inventory/phonotactics—but without any preexisting words to exemplify how I want the language to sound, it feels like I’m choosing phonemes at random and creating arbitrary rules.  In addition, I don’t have a working knowledge of the IPA, so all the “glottal stop” and “dental fricative” terminology is Greek to me (no pun intended).


An alternative approach that I’ve tried is to first develop a grammatical framework. I like to think in terms of hard-and-fast rules without many exceptions, so my ideal language would be a loglang with organized grammar.  However, I still run into the obstacle of simply coming up with words out of thin air.

The poem was written in J́atagé then translated into English. The poem features a syllabic meter of seven, every J́atagé line in this poem is seven syllables except the last line. 

# Activity

Your activity, if you choose to partake in it, is to translate this poem from J́atagé using the gloss below or from English but attempt to preserve the syllabic meter as much as possible. The benefit of this activity is it will get you thinking about diction and possibly inflection and affixation because you need to pick words that mean the same or similar and have a optimal amount of syllables when inflected. You can have the poem be more than seven lines (or less) but as long as there is seven syllables in each line (bar the last) or as close to seven as possible then it is fine.

Let's begin!

&amp;#x200B;

As usual, when I want to make a new root word in **Evra**, I first look for the etymologies of a few words in 'European' (and other) natural languages. Since ""stench"" is a pretty common concept, languages have a great deal of words to describe the qualities and intensity of this unpleasant sensation. Here are some verbs I looked into, among many others:

* (EN) *to stink*: cognate of DE/NL *stinken*, DA *stinke*, and SV *stinka*, all of them meaning the same as English, comes from PGerm *\*stinkwaną*, via PIE *\*steng**^(w)**-* (""to thrust, to strike"")
* (EN) *to smell*: from PIE *\*smel-* (""to burn, to smoke, to smoulder"")
* (PT) *feder* (to stink): from Latin *fētēre*, probably from PIE \**dʰewh₂* (""smoke; mist, haze"")
* (CZ) *smrdět* (to stink): from PIE \**smerd*; and cognate of FR *merde* (""sh\*t"") and the other Romance words for it, which in turn comes from Latin *merda* (""dung, excrement""), probably a parallel evolution of  PSlv *\*smordъ* (""stink, odor"")

&amp;#x200B;

After this etymological trip, I've tried to identify a CVC syllable that is as cross-linguistical and representative as possible, and that complies with Evra sound symbolism and my sense of aesthetics. I went for the root word **PUT-** (/put/).

 

Here the rationale behind my choice:

* /put/ is quite similar to the sound one makes when spitting; and in many cultures, spitting in someone's face is a ""global sign of anger, hatred, disrespect or contempt"" (cit., Spitting, Wikipedia)
* English has the interjection *pooh* (/p^((h))u ː /) expressing disgust at an unpleasant smell
* IT *puzzare*, FR *puer*, RO *a pu**ți* all mean ""to stink"", from Latin  *pūteō* (""I stink""), from PIE \**puH-* (""rotten, foul"")
* PIE *\*puH-* also has a whole lot of cognates, among which:
   * LV *pūt* (to rot)
   * SAN पूयति (*pū́yati*, ""to become foul, putrid; to stink"")
   * Old Norse *fúi* (""decay, rottenness"")
   * EN *foul*
   * EL πύον (*pyon*, ""pus"")
   * FA **پوده** (*pude*, ""foul, rotten"")
* Chinese has 腐 (*fǔ*, ""decay, rotten""), which is not etymologically related to the above words, but, you know, when it comes to Evra, everything goes!

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I had to choose which verb group this PUT- root word falls in. Evra basically has two verb groups:

* (mostly active) verbs ending in ***-e***
* (mostly stative) verbs ending in ***-i***

&amp;#x200B;

The choice was pretty obvious, so I've made the verb ***a puti*** (a stative verbs in ***-i***), with the following meanings:

* to stink, to smell (bad), to give off (bad) smell/odor
* to give an impression of dishonesty, untruth, or sin
* to be greatly inferior, to perform badly, to suck

  
With my great surprise, though, I realized that if I conjugate ***a puti*** in the first person singular, present indicative, I end up with this:

&amp;#x200B;

***putin*** / ˈputin/ = ""I stink""

    puti   -n
    stink  1SG

&amp;#x200B;

And I swear I didn't do it on purpose!

This “conlang” is not a conlang at all. However, it is a secret code used in the Cyrillic alphabet to communicate ideas and thoughts privately. There is a letter for every single English sound, even if there is no Cyrillic equivalent sound. This is why you will occasionally find irregularities in this “conlang”.

Since its creation and its first *leak* here, almost one year ago, the Nool clong has roughy changed, so a new topic was needed.

The grammar pdf is avaiable [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15554YtJZQEfRFEq-NwPN9B8NMcA-u_zZ/view?usp=sharing)**!** 

*Nool* (IPA: /no:l/ \[n̻oːj(˦)˨˥\]) is supposed to be spoken in an universe (or pluriverse if you prefer) roughly similar to ours, in which it belongs to the small Nolic family. Although distinct from Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic languages, interactions with both of them was numerous throughout history, whence many loanwords, especially from Spanish and Classic Arabic, and, more anciently, probably from Guanche...and, nowadays, from English of course. All these bunches of loanwords appears in a very Noolized form though, since Nool phonotax is rather strict: only CV(C)(C) are allowed, with many restrictions in coda itself. For instance, only voiceless can occur after another consonant in it, and a complex coda (i.e. with more than one consonant) cannot co-occur with a long vowel in a syllable, since they cannot weigh more than three morae -note that Nool is mora-timed-, two if the onset is ejective.

Nool is a highly agglutinative language with some fusional features. Hence the notion of stem is as accurate as that of root, but the very majority of the inflection and derivation is conveyed through affixal and clitic concatenation, whose patterns are neat enough to be mappable in ""slots"". Most roots are monosyllabic and CV(C), some are disyllabic, usually CVCV with the second syllable short, open and with /a i u ɨ/ vowels (with many exceptions in loanwords).

As stems taking affixes, all roots are regular except *naaj* ""talking, speech, saying, telling” and *kaj* ""happening, event, process"".

The word order is Verb-initial, more commonly VSO, although VOS is rather frequent too. Like most VO-order languages, Nool is heavily head-initial/right-branched with a strict determinee-determinant order. It is a head-marking language, with an extensive -often mandatory- agreement of the head with its dependencies. This along with pro-dropness, the lack of strictly pronominal independent morphemes and the possibility for a sentence to consist of a sole predicate. Nool has a rich set of conjunctive and discourse clitics (for topicalization, focalization, polarity...).

Other noticeable features are: a large amount of valency affixes, an alignement considered ergative or fluid-S, whose willingly patients are encoded as agents (or even ""austronesian"", since adjuncts can be promoted as agents), ""determinee"" forms for some noun roots (often denoting constitutive parts) and the subordinate morphology which deeply diverges from the one of independent clause, and used in them -mandatorily with inflected negation and yes/no interrogation-. There is a blur between lexical categories: pronouns are hyperonymic nouns -and forming an open class- and any verb can be added an agent without any morphological derivation (see herebelow). Along with this, Nool is a zero-copula language.

As previously said, Nool is a heavily verb-based language, hence any unit of meaning is virtually usable as a verb, which is ergative, i.e. transitive or intransitive by omitting or adding the agent without any derivation required (English does have some of such verbs, yet as a closed class, e.g. break: ""the owl \[+agent\] broke the branch \[+patient\]"" - ""the branch \[+patient\] broke"").

Of course, any constructive feedback is welcome :)",Updated grammar of Nool,"Hello again fellow clongers,

Hence the notion of stem is as accurate as that of root, but the very majority of the inflection and derivation is conveyed through affixal and clitic concatenation, whose patterns are neat enough to be mappable in ""slots"". Most roots are monosyllabic and CV(C), some are disyllabic, usually CVCV with the second syllable short, open and with /a i u ɨ/ vowels (with many exceptions in loanwords).

As stems taking affixes, all roots are regular except *naaj* ""talking, speech, saying, telling” and *kaj* ""happening, event, process"".

The word order is Verb-initial, more commonly VSO, although VOS is rather frequent too. Like most VO-order languages, Nool is heavily head-initial/right-branched with a strict determinee-determinant order. It is a head-marking language, with an extensive -often mandatory- agreement of the head with its dependencies. This along with pro-dropness, the lack of strictly pronominal independent morphemes and the possibility for a sentence to consist of a sole predicate. Nool has a rich set of conjunctive and discourse clitics (for topicalization, focalization, polarity...).

Other noticeable features are: a large amount of valency affixes, an alignement considered ergative or fluid-S, whose willingly patients are encoded as agents (or even ""austronesian"", since adjuncts can be promoted as agents), ""determinee"" forms for some noun roots (often denoting constitutive parts) and the subordinate morphology which deeply diverges from the one of independent clause, and used in them -mandatorily with inflected negation and yes/no interrogation-. There is a blur between lexical categories: pronouns are hyperonymic nouns -and forming an open class- and any verb can be added an agent without any morphological derivation (see herebelow). Along with this, Nool is a zero-copula language.

As previously said, Nool is a heavily verb-based language, hence any unit of meaning is virtually usable as a verb, which is ergative, i.e. transitive or intransitive by omitting or adding the agent without any derivation required (English does have some of such verbs, yet as a closed class, e.g. break: ""the owl \[+agent\] broke the branch \[+patient\]"" - ""the branch \[+patient\] broke"").

That has been changing recently with my most ambitious conlang to date: Hylian! Hylian is spoken by the Hylian people in the Zelda video game series. It's highly agglutinative and draws inspiration from natlangs like Japanese and Latin and from conlangs like Atlantean and Klingon.

I've been interested in conlanging for several years, but I've never had a real in depth knowledge of languages. That has been changing recently with my most ambitious conlang to date: Hylian! Hylian is spoken by the Hylian people in the Zelda video game series. It's highly agglutinative and draws inspiration from natlangs like Japanese and Latin and from conlangs like Atlantean and Klingon.

1212,0,"So I was researching proto-rules in Finnish language, when I stumbled on something interesting: A suffix for ""inclusive embodiment"".

Let me show you examples of old Finnish words:

Olla -&gt; Olio (Be -&gt; Being)

Ilkeä -&gt; Ilkiö (Mean -&gt; Meanie)

Hirveä -&gt; Hirviö (Awful -&gt; Monster)

Yeah. io/iö ending creates an embodiment of any conceptual adjective. 

This could be used to fully get rid of adjectives in a language. Conceptual adjectives can always be thought of as something embodying them either exclusively (brightness is sun) or inclusively (sun is bright), letting them be used as any noun.

While physical adjectives are already just slightly altered versions of nouns: (Like a fish -&gt; fish-like -&gt; fishy)

Answer:

Note 2: In some dialects, /ɣ/ shifted to /ʀ/, turning velar sounds in the surrounding syllables into uvulars

**Syntax**

Sahi is pretty head final, following these patterns:

SOV word order  
Noun - Adjective  
Noun - Particle  
Noun - Postposition  
Possessed - Posessor  
Verb - Auxiliary Verb 

As time goes on and I start to translate more complicated sentences, I will add to this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Grammar**

Being a creole, Sahi is highly analytical, using adjectives and auxiliary verbs for most grammatical functions

*Particles*

How the creole kept these is a wonder, all I know is that i wanted to have some particles

Subject marker - Ku  
Object marker - 'exu  
Possession - \[Owned\] gi \[Owner\]  
Negation - Ra

Note: If 'ra' is used on an inflected verb, it comes before all auxiliaries.

&amp;#x200B;

*Nouns*

Nouns are very simple, 'inflecting' for only number, using adjectives. Inflecting like this is entirely optional.

&amp;#x200B;

|Single|Paucal|Plural|
|:-|:-|:-|
|\[Unmarked\]|\- Muro (Some)|\- Waslo (All)|

&amp;#x200B;

*Adjectives*

Adjectives are very transparently verbs, and can be used as such. While adjectives *can* inflect as verbs can, they may not inflect for the habitual aspect. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Verbs*

Verbs inflect for tense and aspect, using auxililaries

Don't ask about the verbs I chose to be auxiliaries, I don't know myself lol.

||Perfective|Imperfective|Habitual|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Past|\- xena'i (Finish)|\-leha (Sleep)|\- osovi (Be special)|
|Present|\[Unmarked\]|\- warecu (Be aware)|\- osovi (Be special)|
|Future|\-suneya (Go)|\-suneya (Go)|\- osovi (Be special)|

If you want to or feel it necesarry to include multiple auxilliaries (such as specifying the aspect of the future or the tense of the habitual), you should use the present tense or the perfective aspect to show this. Auxiliaries are ordered as they are on the chart, left to right, top to bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

*Transitivity*

To turn an intransitive sentence into a transitive one, simply add an object. It will be interpreted as the subject causing the object to \[verb\].

To perform the reverse, place a dummy pronoun 'Te' in place of the object. Adding 'exu after this is unnecesarry but not grammatically incorrect.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example Sentences**

The sun will rise - 'Karacefu ku leha ra suneya' (lit.: sky-fire subject sleep neg future)

He is running through the field - ''E ku huvoxula 'exu zetu warecu' (lit.: 3ps subject place-grass object run imperfective\_present)

I hate you sometimes - 'Ve ku cu 'exu nediti ra osovi' (lit: 1ps subject 2ps object like neg habitual)

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: Anyone know where I can properly learn how to gloss?","Sahi, my first conlang that I started work on a week ago","**Background**

Sahi (Full name - Sahi gi Ma'ewu Waslo) is a creole of 2 languages in my conworld, and has since undergone hypercorrection. If you notice that it isn't very naturalistic, that's why.

Sahi is spoken across an entire desert continent (name pending), and i wanted readers to be reminded of languages from many warm places around the world, mostly Arabic, Indonesian and Nahuatl

1235,0,"Guten Tagen! here's the link for the first post of this conlang: [https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/tb0wv5/emoji\_conlang/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/tb0wv5/emoji_conlang/)

So, I've made a... few changes, to say the least xd I'm not gonna explain everything bc I'd be here all day, it's rather a summary; and if anyone's interested about furhter details, the comment section is all yours.

The sentence structure isn't as strict as it was:

* \[question word\]🔷\[**subject**🔸adverb(state of subject)\]🔷\[auxilary/modal verbs🔸**type of sentence - action - sign of tense**🔹adverb(object)🔹adverb(manner)\]🔷\[all the other adverbs\]🔷
* parts in **bold** cannot be left out
* for now on, I'll write every adverb as adverb(x), as opposed to e.g. ""adverb of x""
* and yes, the object is handled as an adverb as well

Almost every adverb has an identifying sign which has to be placed before the other parts of the adverb. For example, the sign of adverb(place) is '🗺', and the sign of adverb(object) is '▶'

* I bought bread from the shop - ⭕👤🔷💵⌛🔹▶🍞🔷🗺🏪👉⭕⬛
   * (ignore the ""⭕"" and ""⬛"" signs for now 😅)

This system allows you to place the adverbs in any order you want and to easily identify them. Also, it makes it possible to make a different adposition/pronoun system for every adverb (and for every different position in the sentence). AKA I can reuse a function emoji multiple times. AKA '👇' means both 'here' and 'now' (and will mean many things yet to be thought of).

Also, this adverb system isn't copied from english with its puny 6 adverbs. I used the hungarian adverb system for inspiration, which has give or take 14 adverbs.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to mention is some clauses and signs guiding them

* ⭕ - main clause
* 🔻 - subordinate clause 
* ▪ - well, it connects the suborbinate clause to the main clause
* ⬛ - end of sentence

If we look at the example sencence above, it is surrounded in ⭕s, so it is a main clause.

Now look at a sentence with a subordinate

* We were at school when we died -
   * ⭕👥🔷✋⌛🔷🗺🏫✋🔷1️⃣⏱⭕
   * ▪1️⃣⏱🔻👥🔷☠⌛🔷🔻⬛

It seems strange, but let me explain

* You can look at a subordinate clause as an adverb, just this adverb is a sentence in on itself. 
* In my conlang you can practically write a sentence in the place of an adverb. Combined with the previous analogy, we have a subordinate sencence! Although a very unreadable one, so you can write the subordinate clause after the main clause (and you should xd). 
* Similar to that, a subordinate clause don't have to be in the next line, but that's the favorable option in most of the cases.
* You have to connect the subordinate to the main clause via the '▪' sign. Including this wasn't nescessary, but the whole look is nicer with it.
* The '1️⃣⏱' sign is just an indicator of where the subordinate is from, as well as what type of 'adverb' it is. 
   * The number is the level of the subordinate clause. Take this sentence: 
      * I've written down that we were at school when we died -
      * ⭕👤🔷✍⌛🔹1️⃣▶🔷⭕
      * ▪1️⃣▶🔻👥🔷✋🔷🗺🏫✋🔷2️⃣⏱🔷🔻⬛
      * ▪2️⃣⏱🔻👥🔷☠🔷🔻
   * 'when we died' is inside another subordinate clause, so it is on the second level: it's inside the first level.
   * It allows you to write down the subordinate clauses at any order you like
* At the end of everything, you place '⬛' to end the sentence.

It might seem quite a bit strange, but I think it has a sort of elegance in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I answer any question and receive any suggestions happily.

1236,0,"Been thinking about another conlang radically different from what I normally do. I was inspired by some video called 'grammar from nothing', and so set out to make a proto-language based on this concept.

Long story short, the thing basically looks like Toki Pona but if it was designed by idiots. I haven't made much for vocab for it, but here are some of the highlights:

semantics:

There are no words that overlap in meaning. For instance, there is a word for 'tree', but no words for different types of trees. There is no generic word for 'plant', because that would include 'tree'. Similarily, there is a word for woman and man but no word for person. This is because the people have no concept of categories. Obviously, this is a language spoken by people who don't think too deeply about the world around them. 

There are no personal pronouns. The way to express 'I' is typically to just say 'this/here woman' or 'this/here man'. Other people are either referred to by name, or you just say 'that/there woman/man' while pointing at them. Using this term without pointing at anyone indicates you're talking about someone who is not present, which I sorta like because it gives the language an obviate distinction. 

Speaking of names, there are no dedicated proper nouns. Instead, titles are improvised using common nouns and adjectives. They always consist of two words, being either nouns or adjectives, followed by the word for woman or man (the language is head final). These words typically indicate personality traits or sometimes unusual physical characteristics like being abnormally tall. 

Reduplication of common. Reduplicating nouns indicates plurals, for adjectives its typicaly an augmentative, for verbs its a bit weird. It can either mean the action is done multiple times or continuously over a long period of time. For some, it instead marks an intensive like it does for adjectives. This mostly appears in derivations. For instance, the word for 'to laugh' is just the word for 'to be happy' reduplicated. 

There are no real grammar words, everything is something concrete, be it an object, action, or physical desription. Words for abstract concepts are few, and mostly consists of words involving perception of some sort (such as feeling emotions). However, there is some grammar starting to develop in it. The word for 'to own' started to be used to mark possession, which later got extended to form an adjectival clause, which is primarily used to narrow down definitions since words tend to be quite broad in meaning. There's also sort of an agent marker, but really its just a word meaning 'to be, to do, to be true, to exist, to be real'. There is no word for 'not', instead you use the word that means 'to be false, to be a lie, to be imaginary'. 

There isn't really a clear distinction in animacy, as evidenced by the fact that the word for 'to be' is the same as 'to do'. The language doesn't really distinguish states from actions. There isn't even really a way to indicate animacy, because these proto-humans don't really understand the concept of having a mind or intention. 

There's also not really much in the way of antonyms. Normally the opposite is just assumed unless stated otherwise. For instance, an animal is assumed to be alive unless you explicitly state 'that deer dead'. This may not be too apparent at times, since they still have words for things like 'big' and small', but keep in mind this isn't really a binary state. Actually, they're part of a three-way distinction, with there being no way to say 'average size'. Amusingly, they do understand the concept of averages and normalcy, even do they have no way to bluntly state it. They only state things that are different, because that's more apparent.y

grammar:

The basis of the language is sub-phrases, which consist of a verb and possiblly one noun phrase. All verbs are intransitive, only accepting one argument. This is where the 'agent' marker comes into play, because its impossible for any verb to have more than one argument. To say something like 'I eat an apple', you would litearlly have to say 'this one do apple eat'. Though in practice, it can easily get replaced by an auxiliary verb, and so calling it an adposition is a bit hard. There are also no adpositions, instead coverbs are used. For instance, to say 'I gave the rock to the woman', you would say 'I do rock give woman get'. There is some evidence of adpositional use though. For instance, instruments are consistently indicated with 'to use'. Basically, sentences are always noun-verb noun-verb noun-verb etc... This is why i say the basis of the language are 'sub-phrases'. More accurately, they just form more complex sentences by concatenating simpler ones. In fact, there is no real standard order for each sub-phrase. They're just spoken as they come to mind. The sample sentence I gave earlier could just as easily be said as 'woman get I do rock give' or 'women get rock give I do'. The first could be translated as something like 'the woman got from me a rock' while the latter could be 'the woman was given a rock by me'. 

There is no tense, at all. There is somewhat a concept of time, but its about as basic as you can get. You can say whether its day time or night time, but that's about it. Obviously, this makes relating narratives quite difficult. Its not something these proto-humans do very often, which is why their language is so ill-equipped to do it. They mostly only speak to express what's happening in the current moment. 

Verbs can be placed side by side, with the last acting as an auxiliary verb in a sense. Really, when they something like 'I do apple eat want', its better translated as 'I want that I eat an apple'. In fact, often times speakers will actually say this as 'I do apple eat I want', or sometimes just 'apple eat I want'. 

summary:

As we see, this is clearly a language spoken by people with minds not as advanced as ours. However, I really wonder how much you can avoid abstraction. For instance, how do you express concepts like who, what, when, and where using just concrete tangible terms? You could ask a question by saying 'know want', but would these people really have a concept for 'to know'? Its also sorta annoying not having a word for 'thing'. This means that you can only refer to something by a specific word for it, which possesses a serious issue if you don't know the word, or if you want to express new concepts into the language. For instance, how can you define anything when you can't say its a 'thing'? 

This language could have quite a few practical problems, and I'm not totally sure even how consistent it is. Like, if these people can't understand most abstract concepts, then would they be able to have words for emotions? Of course, in this language their words for emotions are highly basic. They just boil down to 'be happy, 'be sad', 'be scared' and 'be angry'. Essentially the 'emotion' is dictated by its outward expression. These are also kinda broad in meaning, with 'to be scared' also meaning 'to be shocked' or 'to be disgusted'. Essentially, you either enjoy something, it makes you cry, it makes you run away, or it makes you want to smash it. Still though, I wonder if this is too abstract.

Is this too simple? Is it even consistent? The thing does have elements of a true language in it, even though at the same time its basically just supposed to be a step-up from things 'said' by great apes like Kanzi and the late Koko. There is clear syntax here, in that adjectives precede nouns and adverbs, with nouns always preceding verbs and their accompanying adjectives/adverbs. Yeah, there's not much to it, but its still a syntax. The language was intended to be messy and inefficient, but I'd like it to still be consistent. I mean, would people who could only understand concrete concepts have a word 'to know'? Would they really lack generic words like 'person', 'thing', and 'place'? I could see them merging 'person' and 'thing', but would they really have no way to state either? I don't know, this thing is still in its earliest stages of development, but already I think its a mess (and by 'mess', I mean as in its not what I intended).",How 'simple' is too 'simple'?,"Been thinking about another conlang radically different from what I normally do. I was inspired by some video called 'grammar from nothing', and so set out to make a proto-language based on this concept.

Long story short, the thing basically looks like Toki Pona but if it was designed by idiots. I haven't made much for vocab for it, but here are some of the highlights:

semantics:

There are no words that overlap in meaning. For instance, there is a word for 'tree', but no words for different types of trees. There is no generic word for 'plant', because that would include 'tree'. Similarily, there is a word for woman and man but no word for person. This is because the people have no concept of categories. Obviously, this is a language spoken by people who don't think too deeply about the world around them. 

There are no personal pronouns. The way to express 'I' is typically to just say 'this/here woman' or 'this/here man'. Other people are either referred to by name, or you just say 'that/there woman/man' while pointing at them. Using this term without pointing at anyone indicates you're talking about someone who is not present, which I sorta like because it gives the language an obviate distinction. 

Speaking of names, there are no dedicated proper nouns. Instead, titles are improvised using common nouns and adjectives. They always consist of two words, being either nouns or adjectives, followed by the word for woman or man (the language is head final). These words typically indicate personality traits or sometimes unusual physical characteristics like being abnormally tall. 

Reduplication of common. Reduplicating nouns indicates plurals, for adjectives its typicaly an augmentative, for verbs its a bit weird. It can either mean the action is done multiple times or continuously over a long period of time. For some, it instead marks an intensive like it does for adjectives. This mostly appears in derivations. For instance, the word for 'to laugh' is just the word for 'to be happy' reduplicated. 

There are no real grammar words, everything is something concrete, be it an object, action, or physical desription. Words for abstract concepts are few, and mostly consists of words involving perception of some sort (such as feeling emotions). However, there is some grammar starting to develop in it. The word for 'to own' started to be used to mark possession, which later got extended to form an adjectival clause, which is primarily used to narrow down definitions since words tend to be quite broad in meaning. There's also sort of an agent marker, but really its just a word meaning 'to be, to do, to be true, to exist, to be real'. There is no word for 'not', instead you use the word that means 'to be false, to be a lie, to be imaginary'. 

There isn't really a clear distinction in animacy, as evidenced by the fact that the word for 'to be' is the same as 'to do'. The language doesn't really distinguish states from actions. There isn't even really a way to indicate animacy, because these proto-humans don't really understand the concept of having a mind or intention. 

There's also not really much in the way of antonyms. Normally the opposite is just assumed unless stated otherwise. For instance, an animal is assumed to be alive unless you explicitly state 'that deer dead'. This may not be too apparent at times, since they still have words for things like 'big' and small', but keep in mind this isn't really a binary state. Actually, they're part of a three-way distinction, with there being no way to say 'average size'. Amusingly, they do understand the concept of averages and normalcy, even do they have no way to bluntly state it. They only state things that are different, because that's more apparent.y

grammar:

The basis of the language is sub-phrases, which consist of a verb and possiblly one noun phrase. All verbs are intransitive, only accepting one argument. This is where the 'agent' marker comes into play, because its impossible for any verb to have more than one argument. To say something like 'I eat an apple', you would litearlly have to say 'this one do apple eat'. Though in practice, it can easily get replaced by an auxiliary verb, and so calling it an adposition is a bit hard. There are also no adpositions, instead coverbs are used. For instance, to say 'I gave the rock to the woman', you would say 'I do rock give woman get'. There is some evidence of adpositional use though. For instance, instruments are consistently indicated with 'to use'. Basically, sentences are always noun-verb noun-verb noun-verb etc... This is why i say the basis of the language are 'sub-phrases'. More accurately, they just form more complex sentences by concatenating simpler ones. In fact, there is no real standard order for each sub-phrase. They're just spoken as they come to mind. The sample sentence I gave earlier could just as easily be said as 'woman get I do rock give' or 'women get rock give I do'. The first could be translated as something like 'the woman got from me a rock' while the latter could be 'the woman was given a rock by me'.

* Does your language contrast indefinite and definite nouns?
    * How are they marked?
    * What are their semantics? How are definiteness markers employed in narratives?
    * How do such markers interact with other grammatical categories?
* What are some other interesting categories that are marked on nouns in your language? (E.g. nominal TAM)

Basic Grammar: 
Plurals:
Masculine: suffix -uv
Feminine: suffix -e
Neuter: suffix -elv/-lv

Other grammar rules:
Possessive determiners and pronouns are fitted at the end of the noun they refer to ONLY in questions
Example:
What is your name?
Amuskal Khalvuni
What is Nameyour
Amusk -al khalvun -i
What     is  name     your

In the above example, the article ‘is’ or ‘al’ is a suffix. Articles become suffixes in all sentences.
Determiners and pronouns are applied before articles in most cases

The on,y time words are gendered are in their plural form, and even so, not all words are gendered
Only LIVING nouns are gendered, such as God, man, woman, human, kangaroo, koala, fox, etc.

Basic Grammar: 
Plurals:
Masculine: suffix -uv
Feminine: suffix -e
Neuter: suffix -elv/-lv

Other grammar rules:
Possessive determiners and pronouns are fitted at the end of the noun they refer to ONLY in questions
Example:
What is your name?
Amuskal Khalvuni
What is Nameyour
Amusk -al khalvun -i
What     is  name     your

In the above example, the article ‘is’ or ‘al’ is a suffix. Articles become suffixes in all sentences.
Determiners and pronouns are applied before articles in most cases

The on,y time words are gendered are in their plural form, and even so, not all words are gendered
Only LIVING nouns are gendered, such as God, man, woman, human, kangaroo, koala, fox, etc.

**Grammar**

As I want it to be a dignified language, it uses the gloroius SOV word order.

*Persons*

| | |
|:-----:|:---------:|
| I/Me| Veg |
| You (singular) | Tel |
| He | Ego |
| She | Mego |
| It | Lego |
| We | Szah |
| You (plural) | Clav |
| They (men) | Wat |
| They (women) | Meń |

*To be*

Here it's not only used to point who is who, but also to point who executes a task, to here's a large (but yet is shorter than the original, cut off 3 lines to not deal with conjugations) chart:

| | Past | Present | Future | Unknown |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| I | -va | -ve | -vu | -vo |
| You | -ta | -te | -tu | -to |
| He/she/it | -ma | -me | -mu | -mo |
| We | -sza | -sze | -szu | -szo |
| Plural You | -ca | -ce | -cu | -co |
| They | -wa | -we | -wu | -wo |

The Unknown time is commonly used in questions, when the time is not known.

So, as you can see, the 'to be' verb exists as a bunch of postfixes. A note that the ""-"" is not only a prefix/postfix market, but it exists when writing words.

*Plural Number*

Create by adding the prefix s(u)- like this:

plant (planet) --&gt; suplant (planets)

er (man) --&gt; ser (men)

*This*

Er (man) --&gt; De er (this man)

*Graduation of adjectives*

Every adjective in normal form ends with -um

Here's a chart with carum (dark) and ferum (fast):

| Normal | Greater | The Greatest | Fictional |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:-----:|
| carum | caret | carn | carsz |
| ferum | feret | fern | fersz |

The fictional scale is used when something it's too &lt;something&gt; to use greatest.

*Negation*

is done by using the null number.

It can be created by adding the r(e)- prefix like this:

er (man) --&gt; rer (no man)

suplant (planets) --&gt; resuplant (no planets)

*Hightings*

car (dark) --&gt; cart (darkness)

So just add -t postfix

*Diminutive*

Add -s postfix:

maw (cat) --&gt; maws (kitty)

wai (star) --&gt; wais (starry)

*Ownerships*

Person + a (most persons)/n (he, she, it):

Ser (men/people) --&gt; Vega ser (my men/people)

Plant (planet) --&gt; Egon plant (his planet)

*Using words*

A feature took from The Imperial Language, for creating verbs from nouns.

Use it by adding the -st postfix like this:

Dam (sword) --&gt; Damst (to fight)

*Imperative*

Use the base word form without 'to be':

carst-vo (i darken) --&gt; carst (darken!)

*Questions*

| | |
|:----:|:----:|
| Ie | If |
| Dei | Where |
| Ier | Who/what |
| Il | How much |
| Ti | When |
| Od | How |

**Some common words**

Der - here

Ver - there

Dev - somewhere

Szun - somebody

U - and

Iu - nor

A - in

Bo - with

Da - yes

Naw - no

**Example text**

Dei suwai-mo?

Der resuwai-mo,

iu resuplant-mo.

Der cart-mo.

WHERE STARS ARE?

HERE NOSTARS ARE,

NOR NOPLANETS ARE.

HERE DARK IS.

*Where are the stars?*

*There are no stars,*

*nor planets*

*There is dark.*

**Conclusion**

What do you think about it? I have not yet made a name for it nor allocated it to a lore. Yet it just exists, like hoglin in 20w06a.",Yet Unnamed Language (Yul),"This is a language that i've been working on today. It combines some nice features I'd like to see in a conlang.

My question is: Do you know of any natlaŋ that continues to count right-to-left (so three-and-twenty-and-hundred) and if there isn't any, do you have an idea why? All the languages I looked up stop this at 100. And I don't understand why they do this.  


If you don't know about natlaŋs that do this, does your cloŋ do it or anything like it?

1273,0,"Agēre has an unfortunate inflectional system in that it often doesn't differentiate between singular and plural nouns, or between certain verb inflections.  Let's begin by looking at stress in Agēre (yes, the title is a pun, huzzah!  Onward we go...).

Stress in Agēre is based on a mora or 'weight' system where the syllable which contains the third mora from the end of a word gets the stress.  Usually, long vowels make a syllable 'heavy' and short vowels make a syllable 'light', except final long vowels which are treated as light syllables because... well, just because.  As a result, if two words are identical in every manner except the length of their final vowels, they will receive stress on the same syllable (which I will mark henceforth with an acute marker).  This isn't a problem if it happens occasionally but in Agēre it is a regular feature of gender, case, and number marking.  For example, number in first declension nouns differs only in contrastive length of the final example, such that we have the singular **béulore** 'friend (nom. sg.)' and plural **béulorē** 'friends (nom. pl.)'.  In second declension nouns this isn't an issue because the inflectional suffixes differ in composition, **véro** 'fool (nom. sg.)' \~ **véroe** 'fools (nom. pl.)', but in third declension nouns there isn't a difference at all, **pírabe** 'star (nom. sg.)' \~ **pírabe** 'stars (nom. pl.').  The same thing  happens to third declensions nouns in the genitive **pirábio** 'star (gen. sg.) \~ **pirábio** 'stars (gen. pl.) and in the instrumental **pirábiðe** 'star (instr. sg.) \~ **pirábiðe** 'stars (instr. pl.).  This is unfortunate because it means that, in the absence of a verb, the singular and plural forms across three out of Agēre's six cases in the third declension are identical.  It's also unfortunate because a similar thing happens in the 2nd singular and 3rd singular of past tense verbs, e.g. **arádune** 'you were creating' \~ **arádunē** 'he/she/it was creating'.

So what's the solution?  To drop my arbitrary 'final long vowels are actually light syllables' nonsense.  As a result, we now have a stress distinction between certain inflectional forms in the first declension and past tense:

**béulore** 'friend (nom. sg.)' \~ **beulórē** 'friends (nom. pl.)'

**arádune** 'you were creating' \~ **aradúnē** 'he/she/it was creating'

Woo, progress has been made!  But we can go further.  Stress used to be purely a phonotactic issue but, since penultimate stress is now an indicator of the plural number for first declension nouns, it can now spread by analogy to third declension nouns as a morphological feature.  As a result, we now have a stress-marked difference in the third declension between the singular **pírabe** 'star (nom. sg.)' and plural **pirábe** 'stars (nom. pl.').  Furthermore, since the same thing happens in the first declension instrumental plural **beulorḗðe** 'brothers (instr. pl.)', the third declension stress difference can apply a bit more analogy throughout its plurals with the first declension as a template, such that the instrumental singular **pirábiðe** 'star (instr. sg.) is distinguished from the instrumental plural **pirabíðe** 'stars (instr. pl.).

And there we have it.  One change in stress combined with a little bit of spicey analogy, and we have fixed a part of my inflectional system that had been bugging me for far too long.  It doesn't fix every problem, after all the genitives are still identical **pirábio** 'star (gen. sg.) \~ **pirábio** 'stars (gen. pl.).  I'm not sure how I feel moving the stress to make the plural **pirabío** since there isn't a basis for that in other declensions, and technically -**io** is a single syllable and stress never falls on final syllables in words.  That said, I might just decide to level the whole third declension plural with stress that's 'one step to the right' compared to the singular forms as justification for the exception.  

But that's another day's headache.  For now it has removed *a lot* of the ambiguity I was struggling with before, so I'm happy enough for a Thursday's pondering.","The stress of nouns, verbs, and analogy","Agēre has an unfortunate inflectional system in that it often doesn't differentiate between singular and plural nouns, or between certain verb inflections.

1274,0,"Hi everyone! So, yesterday evening I started to work on an emoji language, sort of. The idea is that there are object emojis (house, cat, blonde, etc.) and there are grammar emojis (prepositions, subjects, etc.) and you build up a sentence with the combination of these.

For example: I bought my car from you - 👤🔷💵⌛🔹👤🚗🔷👤👁👉👤 - I⌛ - past tense👉 - ""from""

There aren't many things done yet, the whole thing is in the making, but this is what I've come up so far:

Object and grammar emojis:

* an object emoji means what it is: 🏠 - house, 🚗 -carthey are the nouns, adjectives, adverbs etc.
* a grammar emoji has more meaning than what it is: 👉 - from somewhere/behing somethingthey can be an object, if it is clear what they are

So far non-chategorizable grammar emojis:

* to be - ✋
* passing time - ⏱

Pronouns:

* I - 👤
* you - 👤👁
* he/she - 👤👀
* we - 👥
* you - 👥👁
* they - 👥👀

Tenses:

* past - ⌛
* future - 👀
* present - nope, there's none xd

Signs:

* separating sign - 🔷
* small sep. sign - 🔹
* adjective sign - 🔸 (nice🔸weather)
* combining sign - there isn't one; if you write two emojis right next to each other, their meaning combines: 🚗🏠 - garage; 👀☀ - 'future sun', tomorrow

Prepositions:

* in the house - 🏠⏮
* at the house - 🏠✋
* on the house - 🏠👆
* (going) from the house - 🏠👉
* (going) to the house - 🏠👈
* into the house - 🏠👇⏱🏠⏮ (you are at the house, some time passes, and you're in the house)
* with the house - 🏠✌
* for the house - 🏠👈 (I bought it for you; for you - 👤👁👈)
* &amp;#x200B;
* in front of the house - 👈🏠
* behind the house - 👉🏠
* next to the house - ✋🏠
* above the house - 👆🏠
* under the house - 👇🏠

Posession: you put a pronoun in front of an object emoji (my house - 👤🏠)

This is the structure of every sentence:

* subject, action(verb or noun)|sign\_of\_tense - object\_of\_verb - adverb\_of\_manner - for whom, where, why, with whom/what, how many times, when, other- with whom/what - who you were with during the action or with what you did the action
* You have to follow this order, but ofc can leave out parts of it.

So, how do you make a sentence? Well, for a start, you use the sencente sturcture.A subject and an action (and its parameters) are always needed, the rest is optional.

* I am - 👤🔷✋
* I was running alone - 👤🔷🏃‍♂️⌛🔹🔹🔹🔷👤✌
   * I ran \[missing verb object\]\[missing adverb of manner\]\[missing for\_whom\] with myself

An acion can be a noun or an adjective as well

* This bacon is tasty - 🥓🔷😋🔹🔹🔹

Now let's see an adjective in use

* I love tasty bacons - 👤🔷❤🔹😋🔸🥓🥓🔹🔹

...with a posessive structure

* I love my red house - 👤🔷❤🔹🔴🔸👤🏠🔹🔹

What if an emoji can't represent an action? Remember the combining ""sign""?

* I'm packing in my house - 👤🔷🏋️‍♂️📦🔹🔹🔹🔷👤🏠⏮
   * 🏋️‍♂️ - weight lifting
   * 🏋️‍♂️📦 - weight lifting a box -&gt; packing

Now a slightly more complicated sentence

* Yesterday I hurried angrily to your house on bike to give you the tasty chocolate -👤🔷🚶‍♂️⏱⬇⌛🔹🔹😠🔹👤👁👈🔷👤👁🏠👈🔷🍫➡👤👁🔷🚴‍♂️✌🔷⌛☀

&amp;#x200B;

Now, there are some stuff I haven't talked about here (such as arrows as showing direction), and there are many stuff missing from this language.

I don't even know if you can call it a language. But, sign language is one soo...

Anyways, any suggestions, improvements, some explanation isn't clear?

1275,0,"Hey guys! It's been a while since I last posted something about my conlang. I've been quite busy so I haven't had time to work on it. But now, I'm back!

Now, I know those of you who saw my other posts will probably say: ""Ritz, ANOTHER phonology post?"" while rolling their eyes back.

Yes. It's another phonology post. But I've made some progress with the grammar and other things. I'll clarify more at the end.

For those of you who don't know what Saurian is (and as a refresher for those who do), let me explain.

# Lore

Saurian is a language spoken on the fictional planet ZX-4907-a (called ""Sauria"" for semplicity's sake) in the far-reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, by many races of sapient dinosaur-like aliens called ""Saurians"" (they are basically scalies, with the head, tail and other stuff of dinosaurs but having the general body shape of a human). There are many types of Saurians (from Theropods like T-rex or Spinosaurs, Ceratopsians like Triceratops and even Hadrosaurs like Parasaurolophus or Hadrosaurus), who all speak different languages. The language I'm working on will be the ""Standard"" dialect developed from a Theropod language and spread by the X̌ālix empire (pronunciation below). In addition to Saurians, there are countless other sapient species living on neighbouring continents in Sauria, like the Spaeleans (cave-bears), the Quppe (moose-like people) and the Felitars (saber-toothed cats and other felines). There is also life on moons and other planets of the Saurian system, like the Zri (pterosaur-like beings, more similar to Quetzalcoatlus and other Azhdarchids; they are highly intelligent beings and are very technologically advanced).

So, after a little bit of lore, let us begin with the phonology! (finally)

# Phonology

After many iterations and countless trial and error, I can finally say; my phonology is finally ready!

Here are the consonants:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yoylaz3znkm81.png?width=2910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e38233582cc184eac9a5ae14b02396454769639e

And here are the vowels:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y8r39mu2okm81.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3dc871752ce8ce810f20c746aee78097f5753f3

Possible diphthongs: /ai/, /ae/, /ei/ and /ea/. There are no triphthongs; instead, /h/ is inserted intervocally (e.g. ""aei"" is /aehi/)

1. There are a total of 56 phonemic consonants and 4 phonemic vowels plus length, for a total of 64 phonemes.
2. Obstruents (except uvular obstruents, voiced fricatives lateral and velar affricates) come in four varieties: plain, palatilized, ejective and ejective palatilized.
3. There are also other ejective consonants. There is an ejective alveolar trill (written /r̥'/ and &lt;rh'&gt; in the orthography) and an ejective alveolar lateral fricative (written /ɬ'/ and &lt;ł'&gt; in the orthography).
4. ɬ͡ʀ̥ is a voiceless alveolar lateral trill. It's pronounced as a simultaneous /ɬ/ and /ʀ̥/. It's supposed to mimic the classic dinosaur ""roar"" or ""whispered grunt"".
5. /z/ has many allophones, depending on where it is and what sounds are next to it. It becomes    /ʒ/ before /i/ and/d͡z/ word initially (or /d͡ʒ/ if the initial syllable has /i/).
6. /i/ and /a/ become /ɨ/ and /ɑ/ respectively after uvulars.
7. Velar fricatives /x/ and /ɣ/ become pharyngeal /ħ/ and /ʕ/ after uvulars. So for example a word like ""qax"" would get pronounced /qɑħ/.
8. /ə/ becomes /ɯ/ after velar and uvular consonants. It becomes /ə ː / or /ɯ ː /  only word finally.
9. /r̥/ becomes /ɾ̥/ intervocally. It also devoices vowels (so like ""rhi"" would be /r̥i̥/).
10. Words that start with a vowel have breathy voice. So ""aen"" (or ""haen"") would be /haen/.

# Phonotactics &amp; stress

Saurian's syllable structure is (C)(C)V(C)(C). Here is a table of all the possible consonant clusters (palatilized consonants never cluster):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4js5udw0ikm81.png?width=2810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b60bad66f0c70371212b3771f6b1b654b40cf718

These consonants can serve as the coda of a syllable: /n/, /t͡s/, /t͡ʃ/, /t͡ɬ/, /ks/, /θ/, /s/, /ʃ/, /x/ and /ɬ/.

**Repair strategy:** if a cluster that is not permitted occurs as a resault of compounding or inflection, an extra vowel is inserted. It's always the vowel of the preceding syllable. E.g; /sax/+/ka/= /saxaka/.

**Stress:** Saurian has fixed stress on the second-to-last syllable. If a word has a long vowel, stress falls on that syllable.

# Conclusion and future updates

And we're done! As always, suggestions are welcome in the comments :) Thank you all so much for the support on my previous posts, it reallt means a lot to me.

I plan on doing a BIG post once i finish working on the verb (which will be pretty complex). I've already done some noun morphology, so I'll keep you guys updated. I can't wait to show yoy guys!

So, after a little bit of lore, let us begin with the phonology! (finally)

# Phonology

After many iterations and countless trial and error, I can finally say; my phonology is finally ready!

Here are the consonants:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yoylaz3znkm81.png?width=2910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e38233582cc184eac9a5ae14b02396454769639e

And here are the vowels:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y8r39mu2okm81.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3dc871752ce8ce810f20c746aee78097f5753f3

Possible diphthongs: /ai/, /ae/, /ei/ and /ea/. There are no triphthongs; instead, /h/ is inserted intervocally (e.g. ""aei"" is /aehi/)

1. There are a total of 56 phonemic consonants and 4 phonemic vowels plus length, for a total of 64 phonemes.
2. Obstruents (except uvular obstruents, voiced fricatives lateral and velar affricates) come in four varieties: plain, palatilized, ejective and ejective palatilized.
3. There are also other ejective consonants. There is an ejective alveolar trill (written /r̥'/ and &lt;rh'&gt; in the orthography) and an ejective alveolar lateral fricative (written /ɬ'/ and &lt;ł'&gt; in the orthography).
4. ɬ͡ʀ̥ is a voiceless alveolar lateral trill. It's pronounced as a simultaneous /ɬ/ and /ʀ̥/. It's supposed to mimic the classic dinosaur ""roar"" or ""whispered grunt"".
5. /z/ has many allophones, depending on where it is and what sounds are next to it. It becomes    /ʒ/ before /i/ and/d͡z/ word initially (or /d͡ʒ/ if the initial syllable has /i/).
6. /i/ and /a/ become /ɨ/ and /ɑ/ respectively after uvulars.
7. Velar fricatives /x/ and /ɣ/ become pharyngeal /ħ/ and /ʕ/ after uvulars. So for example a word like ""qax"" would get pronounced /qɑħ/.
8. /ə/ becomes /ɯ/ after velar and uvular consonants. It becomes /ə ː / or /ɯ ː /  only word finally.
9. /r̥/ becomes /ɾ̥/ intervocally. It also devoices vowels (so like ""rhi"" would be /r̥i̥/).
10. Words that start with a vowel have breathy voice. So ""aen"" (or ""haen"") would be /haen/.

# Phonotactics &amp; stress

Saurian's syllable structure is (C)(C)V(C)(C). Here is a table of all the possible consonant clusters (palatilized consonants never cluster):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4js5udw0ikm81.png?width=2810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b60bad66f0c70371212b3771f6b1b654b40cf718

These consonants can serve as the coda of a syllable: /n/, /t͡s/, /t͡ʃ/, /t͡ɬ/, /ks/, /θ/, /s/, /ʃ/, /x/ and /ɬ/.

**Repair strategy:** if a cluster that is not permitted occurs as a resault of compounding or inflection, an extra vowel is inserted. It's always the vowel of the preceding syllable. E.g; /sax/+/ka/= /saxaka/.

**Stress:** Saurian has fixed stress on the second-to-last syllable. If a word has a long vowel, stress falls on that syllable.

# Conclusion and future updates

And we're done! As always, suggestions are welcome in the comments :) Thank you all so much for the support on my previous posts, it reallt means a lot to me.

I plan on doing a BIG post once i finish working on the verb (which will be pretty complex). I've already done some noun morphology, so I'll keep you guys updated. I can't wait to show yoy guys!

Following the format of my past posts, Gwerini draws its primary inspirations from Uralic and Celtic languages, but the result is very different from either family aesthetically. Primary features include: 

- Vowel harmony
- Consonant gradation
- Syntactic gemination
- Highly complex case system with plenty of noncanonical usage
- Lots of quirky subject

All this produces some truly strange word conjugations such as this:

Hello - I've posted a few times about the [Glossary Generator](http://jamesmurdo.com/glossary_generator) tool I made and am glad it's being used by so many writers! It's free, and designed to help you quickly and simply. It also helps massively with displaying where new words you've created and certain phrases have been incorrectly spelt.

You can find an article about it I wrote for Indies Unlimited [here](https://indiesunlimited.com/2020/12/08/update-glossary-generator-for-writers-is-online/). It originally started life as a python program on my computer until I realised it might be useful for other authors too.

The generator combs your uploaded Word file manuscript (nothing saved!) for useful terms and then outputs them as a text file.

The uses of glossary generator:

1. Helps find **glossary terms**
2. Helps find **errors (e.g. naming inconsistencies)**
3. Is **free!**

Any questions, feel free to message me. Enjoy!

Verbs are identical. Suffix ""-t"" shows near-tense.

1303,0,"Numbers of multiple digits are made by just connecting words together. For example instead of 'one hundred twenty three' you would literally say 'one two three'. More than this, it's backwards, with numbers ascending, so it would actually be 'three two one'. Furthermore, numbers are hexadecimal, so actually, it would be 7B, which in aluwa would be 'niku' which is 'ni' for B or eleven, and 'ku' for 7.

The number after 'ha' (F) is 'ninomi' (10) literally 'zero-one', and the number after is 'mimi' (11), literally 'one-one'.

When counting, or if the number isn't being used like an adjective, -haho is on the end, which means 'count'. So 123 dogs is 'kuhuma niku' literally 'dogs 123' or 'dogs 7B' or 'dogs B + 7'. but counting 'one two three' looks like 'mi-haho, wo-haho, sa-haho'.

The numbers 0-F are nino, mi, wo, sa, ki, si, ta, ku, po, la, ko, ni, wi, ho, ma, and ha in that order.

Now, this gets repetitive with big numbers, consider that 1,000,000 (base 16) would be ninoninoninoninoninoninomi-haho. A way of compressing these big numbers is that with repeating digits, instead of saying zero zero zero zero zero zero zero, you can just say 'six zeros' to day 'six zeros' you would say  'zero six-ihi' where -ihi is like 'times'.

For example, since I bet that was confusing, ninoninoninoninoninoninomi-haho can be said 'nino-ta-ihi-mi-haho' literally 'zero six times and one"" one number higher, 1,000,001 would therefore be 'mi-nino-si-ihi-mi-haho', which is 'one, zero five times, and one'

Big numbers can therefore be expressed shortly, for example 10^100 (still base 16 so this is much higher than googol) would be 'zero, zero-zero-one times and one' or 'noni-noninonimi-ihi-mi-haho'.

1305,0,"By the 25th century numerous groups of humans have colonized the gas giants' moons Most of them have become completely culturally separate from the humans of the inner world, appearing quite alien to most other humans after years of no contact. 

One of these groups is the Saji (though that's not the name they use for themselves). The Saji are a group known to terreform moons, and create new species of animal to suite their environments. They're generally a collectivist society, based on utilitarian principles of morality for a so called collective good, they're also known to be mostly classless (most of their nations being governered by elders or millitary leaders) and pretty militaristic. 

Because of the Saji's origins as colonies, they've largely adopted Toki Pona as a universal language. Though the conlang is thought to hail from 21st century earth, it's become useful to the Saji for quick utilitarian communications often between ships, especially with trade and negotiations. It's not their main language conversionally though, being seen as a more formal tounge, almost like the use of Latin on earth. 

They're version of toki pona is also somewhat different from the original, at least in what certain words imply for them. There's simple things like the word 'mun' being used differently in a society that mostly lives on moons. Or more complicated things, like how certain compound words (or just words) have very specific connotations in their culture (such as waso being used to mean 'barbarian' more then it is for 'bird' to the Saji due to their history, to the point where they'd probably have to spefiy if they're using it for an animal). They've even created a number system based on the order of the original 120 words.

1312,0,"I had an idea a few days ago of a language that would be devoid of grammatical person, in the sense that this language would have no personal pronouns or affixes indicating a person.  
Instead, Kpèṇev expresses this through word order.  
In a sentence where the subject is the speaker, the word order is VSO head-initial. Conversely, when the subject is the addressee or something else, the order becomes SOV head-final. The predicate always takes a predicative particle that indicates time, aspect and mood.   Changing the location of this particle in the sentence indicates whether the subject is the speaker, the addressee, or something else.  

Some examples:  

**Òkaṇe ó náṣṭo 'àvasap.**  
*Lit. Open - past perfective - door - big.*  
I opened the big door.  

**'àvasap náṣṭo ó òkaṇe.**  
*Lit. Big - door - past perfective - open.*  
You opened the big door.  

**Ó sàoka.**  
*Lit. Past perfective - see.*  
You saw it.  

**Sàoka ó.**  
*Lit. See - past perfective.*  
You saw me.  

**Ḷa mèkp é sàoka.**

The language is essentially in an embryonic stage, but I found the concept interesting and I wanted to share it.",Kpèṇev: a language without grammatical person,"I had an idea a few days ago of a language that would be devoid of grammatical person, in the sense that this language would have no personal pronouns or affixes indicating a person.  
Instead, Kpèṇev expresses this through word order.  
In a sentence where the subject is the speaker, the word order is VSO head-initial. Conversely, when the subject is the addressee or something else, the order becomes SOV head-final. The predicate always takes a predicative particle that indicates time, aspect and mood.   Changing the location of this particle in the sentence indicates whether the subject is the speaker, the addressee, or something else.  

Some examples:  

**Òkaṇe ó náṣṭo 'àvasap.**  
*Lit. Open - past perfective - door - big.*  
I opened the big door.  

**'àvasap náṣṭo ó òkaṇe.**  
*Lit. Big - door - past perfective - open.*  
You opened the big door.  

**Ó sàoka.**  
*Lit. Past perfective - see.*  
You saw it.  

**Sàoka ó.**  
*Lit. See - past perfective.*  
You saw me.  

**Ḷa mèkp é sàoka.**  
*Lit. This - person - present.  imperfective - see.*  
He/she sees it.

Numbers in Agēre have two forms: a base form, which is the form you use if the numeral stands on its own, and a compound form, which is used when that numeral is compounded to another numeral.  As an example, the base form of 3 is **dure** and the base form of 10 is **gore**.  You would think when you combine them to form 13 you would get **duregore**, however you'd be wrong.  Since we're compounding 10 and 3 to give 13 we have to use the respective compound forms **dura**\- and -**gre** to give us **duragre**.

Following so far? Excellent.

Nouns in Agēre come in three genders: animate, inanimate, and abstract.  While numbers 1 through 10 decline in these three genders, such that **dure** 3 has the inanimate **deor** and abstract **duras**, this is not true of numbers 11 through 19.  In this case, inanimate nouns take the animate adjective and there is no separate inanimate form.  We can therefore take  **pirabe** 'stars' which is an inanimate gender noun and make the phrase '13 stars'  **duragre pirabe.** However, **keakeles** 'crimes' is an abstract gender noun so '13 crimes' would be  **duragras keakeles.**

Still on board? This is where it gets unfortunate.

You see, the numeral 1 has the base form **vie** and the compound form **via**\-.  This is fine when combined with the compound form of 10 -**gre** to give us **viagre**, but when accompanying a noun in the abstract gender it becomes... well... **viagras**...

This was totally unintentional, it totally made me blush when we saw it, but I've used **vie** as my inanimate article so I'm too far in to change it.  Kind of a nice little quirk I think!

1320,0,"I've had this idea since the birth of my original character that used to live in swamps. I wanted it to feature quirky writing, complicated phonetics, and flexible grammar and I'm kinda making it!

##Phonetics

There are quite a bit of consonants here. Like, quite, quite a bit. Sorry for not making a table, it would take forever...

Plosives: p, b, t, d, ʈ, ɖ, k, kʼ
Nasals: m, n, ɳ, ŋ
Trills: r
Taps: ɾ
Fricatives: f, ð, ɬ, x
Affricates: ʈʂ, tʃ, ɖʐ
Approximants: ɹ, j
Lateral approximants: l, ɭ

Vowels? Vowels.

Close: i y    u
Mis-close: ə o
Mid-open: ɛ    ʌ
Open: a    ɑ

##Phonotactics

These make a lot of sense, I swear. X) (i mean, you clearly can't combine a dental t with a retroflex d, that will end the universe, so...)

1. If any dental/post-alveolar plosive stands behind any retroflex plosive, the first will be doubled and vice versa.
2. If any unvoiced plosive stands behind its voiced variant, the first will be doubled and vice versa.
3. If any non-labial plosive stands behind ð, they become a t͡ð/d͡ð affricate, OR the plosive is dropped.
4. If r collides with ɾ in any order, they fuse into r.
5. If l collides with ɭ in any order, the second is doubled, and the first is dropped.

##Writing system

Piliotch = ideography. Hieroglyphs are all roots with certain meanings, roots are always one syllable. The syllable structure is CV(C)(C) for anything except morphemes, particles, etc that serve a strictly grammatical purpose, those use V(C)(C) structure. Hieroglyphs often serve a purpose of letters to build words, and the spelling is fixed for each word. For example, a tree is currently ɾinbɑbox - plantbigstrong, which is kinda long in my opinion so I might change it later. I would show an image of hieroglyphs, but it's impossible due to mobile reddit's limitations, unfortunately. 
I will also skip the ""alphabet"" part since it's hella long and I am hella lazy and I can't even pin a picture at the moment so here we go:

##Grammar

**Nouns** don't use any auxiliary morphemes to show their part of speech, they simply exist like this. liɳ is love (~~I LOVE LEAN!!!~~), while liɳotʃ is an adjective which means 'adorable'. Now you can guess that ""pil"" in Piliotch means something, and I will tell you that the noun of this means 'swamp'.
Anyways, there are 5 cases in Piliotch, and they're used in nouns, pronouns, and adjectives - and adjectives have a quirk of having a different pronunciation for the same hieroglyph, so the first variant is nouns/pronouns, and the second is adjectives.

Nominative: - / otʃ
Relative: aʈʂ / atʃ
Directive: uʈʂ / utʃ
Ablative: ɛʈʂ / ɛtʃ
Locative: iʈʂ / itʃ

*Relative case*: Direct objects, dependent words, originating from/leaving from sth. ɖoxaʈʂ ʈyn - person's animal. daʈaɛt pilaʈʂɑ (incorporation (will explain this later): ɑʈʂapilədaʈaɛt) - comes from swamps.

*Directive case*: Action directed to an object, direction towards an object. daʈaɛto ʈynuʈʂ (incorporation: ʈʂuʈynədaʈaɛt) - comes towards animal. piluʈʂ ɖox - a person inside a swamp.

*Ablative case*: Action done using an object. pɛxaɭ rɛʈʂ (incorporation: ʈʂɛrɛupɛxaɭ) - was hitting with a rock. ɖoxɛʈʂ ɾin - a plant wielding a person. (Doesn't matter that a plant normally can't wield a human, it explains the grammar.)

*Locative case*: helps express location. Must be modified with a preposition. daʈiɛt opʈyniʈʂ (incorporation: ʈʂiʈynpoudaʈiɛt) - has now been riding an animal. oɭɾiniʈʂ ɖox - a person near a plant.

**Verbs** use 8 convenient tenses: 4 imperfect, 4 perfect tenses. It can also use its subject's gender suffix or use common gender suffix, too, but that's not necessary, and is used mostly to divide illegal or inconvenient consonant clusters. (Like daʈaɛ`t ɖ`ox)

*Imperfect form*: syllable nucleus a
*Perfect form*: syll nucleus i

*Infinitive*: coda t
*Past tense*: coda ɭ
*Present tense*: coda ɛt
*Future tense*: coda nt

*Imperative form* is made using the verb root, connector schwa, and a pronoun.

Verb root daʈ (to move) + ə + pronoun tat (you) = sth like 'move!' asking someone to start walking, for example.
What's cool is that you can make an imperative form to a third or first person with this! Like ""i want this guy to move"" and ""i must go now"".

**Adverbs** don't have any declensions and only use the suffix -ɛkʼi.
*daʈaɛto ɳulɛkʼi ɖoxo. {Walks slowly person.}*

**Noun incorporation** is a common thing in Piliotch. Means an object can be ""glued"" onto its head verb. The ""glue"" here is a forementioned connector schwa (if it stickies to vowels *a, ɛ, o, ɑ* then vowel *u* is used instead of schwa), the object noun ""glues"" behind the verb, and suffixes turn into prefixes going in the opposite order, even phonetically:

*pɛxat ɾinaʈʂ - ʈʂaɾinəpɛxat (hit a plant);*
*daʈat ɖoxuʈʂ - ʈʂuɖoxədaʈat (approach a person)*
In case an adjective is dependent on the noun, the latter cannot be incorporated into its verb.

**Plural forms** apply to nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. There are three forms: singular, paucal, and plural. The Piliotch speaking cultures use base-9 counting (by grouping up dots) so anything less or equal 9 uses paucal, and anything more than 9 uses plural form.

Form\gender | masc | fem | com 
Singular | u | ʌ | o 
Paucal | i | y | ɑ 
Plural | a | ɛ | ɑ 

**Prepositions** are prefixes. They basically serve as operators for locative case words, and the way they work is fairly simple - it just sticks behind the word! As simple as that. Of course, phonotactic rules apply in case there's an 'illegal' phoneme combination, like otɖoxiʈʂ -&gt; ottoxiʈʂ.

Oh well, that's all I have at the moment! When I've been working on this conlang, I wanted it to have a fairly predictable and regular grammar, laconic writing (by compressing roots and morphemes etc into single ""letters"") while having a quirky pronunciation even if it would be obscure and hard to learn to fluently speak. What are yall's opinions on this? Perhaps criticism or advice for improvement? Please let me know, I would love some feedback!","Introduction to Piliotch, my first completely own conlang!","I've had this idea since the birth of my original character that used to live in swamps.

What's cool is that you can make an imperative form to a third or first person with this! Like ""i want this guy to move"" and ""i must go now"".

**Adverbs** don't have any declensions and only use the suffix -ɛkʼi.
*daʈaɛto ɳulɛkʼi ɖoxo. {Walks slowly person.}*

**Noun incorporation** is a common thing in Piliotch. Means an object can be ""glued"" onto its head verb. The ""glue"" here is a forementioned connector schwa (if it stickies to vowels *a, ɛ, o, ɑ* then vowel *u* is used instead of schwa), the object noun ""glues"" behind the verb, and suffixes turn into prefixes going in the opposite order, even phonetically:

*pɛxat ɾinaʈʂ - ʈʂaɾinəpɛxat (hit a plant);*
*daʈat ɖoxuʈʂ - ʈʂuɖoxədaʈat (approach a person)*
In case an adjective is dependent on the noun, the latter cannot be incorporated into its verb.

**Plural forms** apply to nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. There are three forms: singular, paucal, and plural. The Piliotch speaking cultures use base-9 counting (by grouping up dots) so anything less or equal 9 uses paucal, and anything more than 9 uses plural form.

Form\gender | masc | fem | com 
Singular | u | ʌ | o 
Paucal | i | y | ɑ 
Plural | a | ɛ | ɑ 

**Prepositions** are prefixes. They basically serve as operators for locative case words, and the way they work is fairly simple - it just sticks behind the word! As simple as that. Of course, phonotactic rules apply in case there's an 'illegal' phoneme combination, like otɖoxiʈʂ -&gt; ottoxiʈʂ.

Oh well, that's all I have at the moment! When I've been working on this conlang, I wanted it to have a fairly predictable and regular grammar, laconic writing (by compressing roots and morphemes etc into single ""letters"") while having a quirky pronunciation even if it would be obscure and hard to learn to fluently speak.

I’m back after a one-month hiatus with the third episode of How to Make an A Posteriori Language!! Videos will be coming weekly now for the foreseeable future. 

Future languages, alternate history languages – Chakobsa, Trigedasleng, Azrán, Brithenig – how do you build a conlang from natlangs?

There are a ton of great conlanging tutorials out there, but none focusing specifically on a posteriori conlanging. And there ARE specific skills you need to make a posteriori languages – I learned this the hard way. This is the third episode in a series about how to make naturalistic a posteriori languages. We learn how to research natural languages in order to make naturalistic a posteriori conlangs – which resources to use, which languages to research, how much to research, and how to research in the first place. 

Would love if you all watched and subscribed and gave feedback in the comments there or here – thanks!!",How to Make an A Posteriori Language – Part 3: Research,"[https://youtu.be/4drMD4pF\_kw](https://youtu.be/4drMD4pF_kw)

## Theme: ADJECTIVES, ADVERBS, &amp; MODIFIERS

The theme for this issue is modification in conlangs. We're looking for articles about how adjectives, adverbs, determiners, and other types of modification might work in your language. Do your adjectives show any agreement patterns? Do they function more widely as nouns, verbs, or are they their own distinct class? Do adverbs function differently from adjectives? How are multiple adjectives handled? How can nouns modify other nouns in your language? There are many, many different paths to take with this topic, and we're excited to see what you all come up with!

## Challenge

For this challenge, tell us a bit about some common property concepts in your conlang! How does your language divide the semantic space for size words like big, large, long, tall, wide, thick, deep, heavy, old, young, small, little, narrow, thin, short, tight, shallow, light? The different sorts of dimensions described by these words can be broken up lots of different ways. Think about how in English, the opposite of 'short' can be 'tall' or 'long' depending on the sense--that must mean there's some polysemy going on! Do you make a distinction between things that are large/small for what they are versus large/small in general? A small elephant is probably still bigger than a massive mosquito, after all. How about color words? Languages famously carve the color space differently. How does yours do it? What does it lump and what does it split?

Tell us about the grammatical side of things too: how do you lexicalize property concepts? Do they have their own part of speech or do they tend to be part of some other class, like verbs or nouns? Do different types of predicates get lexicalized differently? How do you do attributive modification? How about property predicates?

I’m creating this language for one of the ethic groups of my main world: Emlhah. 

My goal is to develop the language until I can make subordinates clause and small translations.

I’m sorry about the big table of phonetic inventory.

I’m looking for **feedback** on **vowel fusion, the phonetic inventory, phonotactic** and my English I guess (I still make mistakes lmao) but any constructed criticism is more than welcome :D.

# Introduction

**The people**

Altarakian is a language spoken in the Altarak’s peninsula (Image), in the continent of Lekiel. It is spoken mainly by the altaraks, and due to the political structure of the Union of Altarak, it is also spoken by elmians, yazuaks, xuul and suolen minorities 

The altaraks are the descendants of the taltaltalians, an ethic group that establish themselves on the peninsula due to war in their homeland. They used to spoke a tonal language, but in altarakian the tones disappeared. 

**The language**

Altarakian is completely agglutinative language, that presents noun classes based on animacy (animate human, non-human, abstract, physical, divine), slipt ergativity, and lots and lots of affix. The main base of the language are affixes, like most other agglutinative language.

   

# Phonology

## Vowels

  

[Sorry i was too lazy to redo the table here.](https://preview.redd.it/ltxuz8vdxpl81.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c2c92c737faebd6b24e034c9a0c1732e4d196b1)

&amp;#x200B;

Altarakian presents 10 vowels.

Vowel harmony is present, specifically, front-back harmony.

The central vowel ə is neuter and opaque, while /e/ and /i/ are neuter, but transparent

The vowel /a/ extends between front and central. Most of the variant here are allophones.

The root determines the vowel changes.

## Vowel fusion

Altarakian permits certain diphthongs, this been: **ie, ei, ia, ai, io, oi, iu, oi, iə, əi,** and any combination between ə, ɛ.

Because of this, when two vowels get into contact, whether for grammatical or any other reason, these tend to go through the process of vowel fusion. 

The fusions depend on openness and position, but to speed off this, here is a table:

  

https://preview.redd.it/7weipu0pxpl81.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1a7eb5a5283c869d57a57d74d1aa52734c593c3

In case it is the same vowel, it tends to just assimilates into one, except it one vowel belongs to a voiceless occlusive   (t,k etc) . In this case, the consonant tends to aspirate.

# Conclusion

You are an awesome person for reading, and I hate making phonotactics.",Introduction to Altarakian and Altarakian Phonology,"# Prelude

I’m creating this language for one of the ethic groups of my main world: Emlhah. 

My goal is to develop the language until I can make subordinates clause and small translations.

I’m sorry about the big table of phonetic inventory.

I’m looking for **feedback** on **vowel fusion, the phonetic inventory, phonotactic** and my English I guess (I still make mistakes lmao) but any constructed criticism is more than welcome :D.

# Introduction

**The people**

Altarakian is a language spoken in the Altarak’s peninsula (Image), in the continent of Lekiel. It is spoken mainly by the altaraks, and due to the political structure of the Union of Altarak, it is also spoken by elmians, yazuaks, xuul and suolen minorities 

The altaraks are the descendants of the taltaltalians, an ethic group that establish themselves on the peninsula due to war in their homeland. They used to spoke a tonal language, but in altarakian the tones disappeared. 

**The language**

Altarakian is completely agglutinative language, that presents noun classes based on animacy (animate human, non-human, abstract, physical, divine), slipt ergativity, and lots and lots of affix. The main base of the language are affixes, like most other agglutinative language.

   

# Phonology

## Vowels

  

[Sorry i was too lazy to redo the table here.](https://preview.redd.it/ltxuz8vdxpl81.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c2c92c737faebd6b24e034c9a0c1732e4d196b1)

&amp;#x200B;

Altarakian presents 10 vowels.

Vowel harmony is present, specifically, front-back harmony.

The central vowel ə is neuter and opaque, while /e/ and /i/ are neuter, but transparent

The vowel /a/ extends between front and central. Most of the variant here are allophones.

The root determines the vowel changes.

## Vowel fusion

Altarakian permits certain diphthongs, this been: **ie, ei, ia, ai, io, oi, iu, oi, iə, əi,** and any combination between ə, ɛ.

Because of this, when two vowels get into contact, whether for grammatical or any other reason, these tend to go through the process of vowel fusion. 

The fusions depend on openness and position, but to speed off this, here is a table:

  

https://preview.redd.it/7weipu0pxpl81.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1a7eb5a5283c869d57a57d74d1aa52734c593c3

In case it is the same vowel, it tends to just assimilates into one, except it one vowel belongs to a voiceless occlusive   (t,k etc) . In this case, the consonant tends to aspirate.

Suppletivelang is the working title of my third major conlang. It will eventually have its own endonym, and as will become apparent below, Suppletivelang is no longer the best name for it, but I'll keep using it here. I'll talk a bit about the background of the project and then show the system I ended up with.

This project started as an experiment in making a naturalistic language that productively used suppletion (where the inflected forms of a word are unrelated to each other, like go/went or good/better). I quickly discovered that ""naturalistic productive suppletion"" just doesn't work, by definition of ""productive"" and ""suppletion."" Focusing on noun plurals, two main options presented themselves:

* Option 1: Every noun has a unique plural form, which is not predictable from the singular form and cannot be described by a regular rule. This fits the criteria for suppletion, but it's not productive: every plural form has to be specified in the dictionary, and by definition there's no way to generate the plural form by rule. This also isn't very naturalistic, because our language faculty loves rules, and because every time someone wanted to use a new noun, they would have to make up an arbitrary plural form and hope people understood them. (""You have a cow, but I have two...what's a good word...'vrxl'!"")
* Option 2: The plural form looks unrelated to the singular form on the surface, but can be derived by some rule (whether having to do with the form, semantics, or something else). That would be productive, but it's not ""suppletion"" in the strict sense because suppletion defies rules by definition.

The system I ended up with is a variation on Option 2. For any given noun, the plural form has two components: (1) a heavily reduced form of the singular root, and (2) a ""plural morpheme"" that is wholly unrelated to the singular form. Which plural morpheme you use will be determined by the semantic class of the noun: all nouns referring to birds have the same plural form, all nouns for flowers have the same plural, and so forth - in other words, plural noun classifiers.

The twist is that because the root is so heavily reduced in the plural, this produces a lot of homophones, so the plural classifier carries a lot of functional load in distinguishing between roots. I think this is the closest thing to productive suppletion that I can manage, though I would be interested to see if people have other ideas. The details of the system are described below to make it clear.

**Case**

Suppletivelang marks seven cases on nouns, by means of prefixes. Case marking falls into three inflection classes, which roughly correspond to human nouns (A), non-human countables, including animals (B), and substances, locations, or intangibles (C). Class A has a distinct marker for every case, while classes B and C show two different patterns of syncretism.

(All examples are in IPA, with penultimate stress. Adjacent vowels are separate syllables.)

|Dative|ne-k'enu|ju-maa|ne-p'ua|
|Locative|ju-k'enu|ju-maa|ju-p'ua|
|Instrumental|pi-k'enu|pi-maa|na-p'ua|

**Number**

Suppletivelang distinguishes singular, dual, and plural number. Dual and plural are marked by classifier morphemes that depend on the semantics of the noun. Number classes do not perfectly overlap with the three case classes; ultimately both are lexically specified. Some examples of the number classes are below (I plan for there to be more than this).

|Class #|Description|Dual|Plural|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Human|\-jopo|\-t'aki|
|2|Body parts| \-ʔea|\-k'ope|
|3|Mammal|\-t'ona|\-wene|
|4|Fish|\-t'ona|\-woʔo|
|5|Insect|\-t'ona|\-jeka|
|6|Flowers|\-juni|\-juni|
|X|Always singular|NA|NA|
|Y|Always plural|NA|NA|

When combined with one of these classifiers, the root noun undergoes extreme subtractive morphology, leaving only the stressed syllable (so *k’enu* becomes just *k’e-, maa* becomes just *ma-*). The dual or plural morpheme thus carries the most phonological weight in the word.

&amp;#x200B;

|Gloss|Class|Singular|Dual|Plural|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|'friend'|1|k'enu|k'e-yopo|ke-t'aki|
|'edible fish'|4|maa|ma-t'ona|ma-woʔo|
|'daylily'|6|mani|ma-juni|ma-juni|

(*k'e-* becomes *ke-* to dissimilate from the following ejective in *ke-t'aki.*)

Note that in the case of *maa* ‘edible fish’ and *mani* ‘daylily’, both roots reduce to *ma-,* so the classifier morphemes are the only thing distinguishing the two lexemes in the dual and plural. If we did this in English, the plurals of *bluebird* and *bluebell* might be something like *blu-flock* and *blu-bouquet* respectively. (I based this partially on Chinese characters, which have a phonetic and semantic component that combine to make the full character.)

By the way, all of the classifiers come from nouns referring to pairs or groups, which still exist in the language: *t’ona* means ‘mating pair (animal)’, *woʔo* means ‘school of fish’, *juni* means ‘bouquet’, etc. This dual/plural system arose through compounding: \**ma(a)-woʔo* ‘edible fish-school’. This is relevant for the next section, where we talk about how dual and plural number influence case marking.

**Case marking in dual and plural**

Because the dual and plural “classifiers” are also nouns in Suppletivelang, they themselves fall into one of the three case inflection classes (A, B, C). In a dual or plural construction, the “classifier” is really the head of a compound, and as such, it governs the case marking of the construction. Sometimes, the case class of both the dual and plural classifiers matches that of the root, so that the case marking is consistent across the paradigm. *k’enu* ‘friend’ belongs to class A, as do *jopo* ‘pair of humans’ and *t’aki* ‘crowd’.

|'friend'|Singular (A)|Dual (A)|Plural (A)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nominative|k'enu|k'e-jopo|ke-t'aki|
|Accusative|to-k'enu|to-k'e-jopo|to-ke-t'aki|
|Genitive| ʔa-k’enu |ʔa-k’e-jopo|ʔa-ke-t’aki|
|Ablative|na-k'enu|na-k'e-jopo|na-ke-t'aki|
|Dative|ne-k'enu|ne-k'e-jopo|ne-ke-t'aki|
|Locative|ju-k'enu|ju-k'e-jopo|ju-ke-t'aki|
|Instrumental|pi-k'enu|pi-k'e-jopo|pi-ke-t'aki|

However, if the dual or plural classifier belongs to a different case class from the root, the case marking in dual or plural number may differ from the singular. *maa* ‘edible fish’ is a perfect example: *maa* and its dual classifier *t’ona* ‘mating pair’ belong to case class B, while the plural classifier *woʔo* ‘school of fish’ belongs to class C. The case prefixes that are different in the plural are bolded.

|'edible fish'|Singular (B)|Dual (B)|Plural (C)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nominative|maa|ma-t'ona|ma-woʔo|
|Accusative|to-maa|to-ma-t'ona|**ne-**ma-woʔo|
|Genitive| na-maa |na-ma-t'ona|na-ma-woʔo|
|Ablative|na-maa|na-ma-t'ona|na-ma-woʔo|

|Locative|ju-maa|ju-ma-t'ona|ju-ma-woʔo|
|Instrumental|pi-maa|pi-ma-t'ona|**na-**ma-woʔo|

To be able to predict the full paradigm of a root, you have to know both the case and number inflection classes that it belongs to. This roughly patterns with semantics but is not fully predictable; speakers just have to know this information for every noun.

* *k’enu* ‘friend’ belongs to case class A, number class 1
* *maa* ‘edible fish’ belongs to case class B, number class 4

Since the number class of a root determines which dual and plural classifiers it will take, it also predicts what case pattern the dual and plural will follow, so this does not have to be specified separately for each root. The last table shows the case class of the dual and plural forms for each of the number classes given above.

Things I noticed:

* The last word in every line has two syllables and penultimate stress, thus stress rhythm!
* ""eigaan"" ""my"" (I.GEN) is used in line one, three and five, alliteration!
* \[uz\] appears three times in neighbouring lines, alliteration.
* \^ complemented by the third line's \[az.a\] and \[uz...\]
* If you noticed something I didn't feel free to comment.

1368,0,"The Reading Group has just finished Warlpiri, and while most of George Nash's grammar just served to convince me that non-configurationality Doesn't Actually Exist, the \*very last chapter\* got me to understand why people who did not have the advantage of an additional 40 years of syntactic theory to be taught to them in grad school might have thought that it did.

The Neat Part is this example:

Ngarrka-ngku marlu-0 marna-0-kurra luwa-rnu nga-rninja-kurra  
man-ERG kangaroo-ABS grass-ABS-OBJ.CMP shoot-PST eat-INF-OBJ.CMP  
""The man shot the kangaroo that was eating grass.""

(Nash would probably hate me for this gloss, because he did not believe in zero morphemes, but one of the nice things about grammar writers including the data that backs their analyses is that I can decide they are wrong and come up with my own analyses, and there are *totally* zero morphemes here. Also, Nash was writing pre-Leipzig, so I'd've updated his glosses anyway.)

""that was eating grass"" is encoded by the discontinuous constituent ""marnakurra ... ngarninjakurra"". The suffix ""-kurra"" is kind of a subordinator, but it doesn't actually introduce or conclude or in any way bound its associated clause, nor is it an inflection on the verb--rather, it gets attached at the right edge of any discontinuous strings which are logical components of a non-finite subordinate clause whose subject slot is coindexed with the matrix clause's object--thus allowing one to filter out which chunks of the sentence belong at which clausal level and reconstruct them, regardless of how they are intermixed. (There are other distinct suffixes for components of clauses attached to different matrix arguments or acting as adverbial adjuncts.)

Similar things happen with nominal phrases, but that's not really a big deal--Russian and Latin can both do the thing where you have a noun and an adjective that describes it clear at opposite ends of a sentence, but nobody calls them ""non-configurational"".

There are other rules which restrict word and phrase ordering (in some ways which make it very tempting to joke that Warlpiri is \*clearly\* just a highly divergent dialect of German!), but one can in fact intermix components of at least 5 different clauses (possibly more if I counted wrong) and still fully recover the logical form, and that's pretty dang cool. The more discontinuity there is, the longer the full sentence will be due to extra marking, but you can do it. And Latin can't do that! (Meanwhile, Kayardild has obligatory redundant marking of all dominating syntactic categories on all words; I don't know if the same kind of intermixing is the reason for that, not having actually read a proper Kayardild grammar yet, but I suspect it might be, and in that case, sentences just *are* long, and don't get shorter if you try to optimize for contiguity.)

As far as I can tell, full sentences still must be contiguous; there is no morphology that would allow you to pick apart pieces of two independent main clauses that were intermixed, and top-level phrase structure rules wouldn't allow it anyway. And there are hard limits on recursion and duplication--you can only have one of each clause type per sentence, and subordinate clauses cannot contain additionally-subordinated clauses. But the pre-1980 chronolect of Warlpiri apparently also had a complement clause structure which neutralized case marking, was obligatorily contiguous, and relied strictly on syntax to disambiguate argument roles, so clearly this kind of thing can be mixed in to a language with options for more traditional syntactic mechanism to allow to get at more complex structures. And while I still don't believe in non-configurationality, this really does give a whole new meaning to ""free word order""!

So, that's a cool thing I learned this week.

This week's paper was sent to me by u/PyrolatrousCoagulate, and I decided to use it in a TyPoW. According to the paper, ""engagement refers to a grammatical system for encoding the relative accessibility of an entity or state of affairs to the speaker and addressee"". It is a relatively newly-established grammatical category, and is, as far as I can tell, not that widely known among us. An example from Andoke, an South American isolate, goes as follows: *páa bʌ ʌpóʼkə̃i* 'The day is dawning (as we can both see).', *páa kẽ ʌpóʼkə̃i* 'The day is dawning (as I witness, but which you were not aware of)'. Now onto the prompts:

* Does your language feature engagement systems?
    * How do they work?
    * Have you considered diachronical processes while creating it?
    * How does engagement interact with other epistemic modes of access?
* Does your language feature evidentiality or egophoricity?

# Background

Varamm started as an attempt at [Speedlang Challenge 8½](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/oxd2m8/speedlang_challenge_8½/) by u/Anhilare last August. I put in about 10 days work and got maybe 2/3 of the way to being able to translate some sentences before I was due to move into my new apartment for school and was too busy to finish in time. I took a hiatus of a couple months to get settled into school life and have been working on it like any of my other conlangs ever since: slow and relaxed. I finally think Varamm is to a point that I'm happy to share it. Given that the challenge had some specific requirements, I'll intersperse how I addressed them throughout this introduction to Varamm. Firstly....

# Locale and Influences

The challenge specifically outlined that the speedlang was to be an isolated language far in the mountains of any range of our choosing and that the surrounding natlangs had to have some influence on the speedlang. I chose the wet (southern) Andes as my mountain range. My style or preferred method of conlanging already leans pretty heavily on stealing from natlangs and marrying their different features together into something unique so I set about making notes of the surrounding natlangs: primarly Mapuche, Quechua as well as a little Spanish and Tehuelche &amp; Ona. I also included Rapa Nui in the list as a wild card due to it's connections (albeit colonial) with Peru and by extension Quechua.

After I picked up the conlang again post school move, I also included Malagasy to round out my Oceanic influence, some Hebrew and Arabic, and some Georgian as another wildcard from another mountain range. Barring Malagasy, I also have friends who can speak these languages so I can pick their brain should I ever find myself lacking in resources. The Malagasy and Semitic influences are mostly there for something for me to lean on syntactically, and Georgian mostly exists as a source for me to steal words from nowadays.

Due to this shift away from the speedlang and turning this into a personal artlang, Varamm has also since been subsumed into the conworld that my other major conlangs all exist in. Varamm now occupies a mountainous region neighbouring Tokétok's vast temperate rainforests, but they're wholly unrelated to each other, barring the beginnings of a sprachbund. I had had a conlang planned for this region for ages and the region was inhabited by a race of derived caprinae (goats). Some of the initial notes I had on this culture have weedled their way into Varamm.

# Phonology

**Consonants**

||Labial|Dental|Alveolar|Retroflex|Velar|Uvular|Glottal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nasal|m m**ː**|n̪ n̪**ː**||(ɳ)|ŋ ŋ**ː**|(ɴ)||
|Plain Stop|p|t̪||ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ** ʈ͡ʂ**ʳː**|k|q|(ʔ)|
|Ejective Stop|p'|t̪'|||k'|q'||
|Unvoiced fricative||s̪||ʂ**ʳ** ʂ**ʳː**|x||h|
|Voiced fricative|v v**ː**|z̪|ɹ̝|ʐ**ʳ** ʐ**ʳː**||||
|Vibrant|||ɾ|(ɽ)||ʀ||
|Approximant||l̪ l̪**ː**|||w|||

*Allophony:*

* \[ɳ\] is an allophone of \[n\] and \[ɴ\] of \[ŋ\] before their respective place series.
* \[ɽ\] only really still exists for conservative speakers, it was the original rhotic whence the retroflex and alveolar series evolved.
* \[ʔ\] appears before otherwise vowel initial words but has no bearing on morphophonology.
* \[x\] has largely merged with \[h\] but the contrast is still maintained in the orthography and fortition patterns as you'll see below.
* \[ɹ̝\] can be geminate or co-occur with a tap: \[ɾ͡ɹ̝̊\]. It evolved from the old geminate \[ɾ **\~** ɽ\] and only patterns as a geminate.
* \[ʀ\] patterns as a geminate in coda position.
* Word final geminates degeminate but still affect prosody.

&amp;#x200B;

*Rhotics and Contrasts:*

One of the requirements of the initial speedlang challenge was to have more than 2 rhotics. Varamm arguably has 3-6 rhotics, depending on how you analyse it: /ɾ/, /ɹ̝/ &amp; /ʀ/, and /ʂ**ʳ**/, /ʐ**ʳ**/, and /ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**/. They all evolved from the old rhotic in some way, largely still pattern in the same way, and are phonemically contrastive from each other. The latter 3 retroflex consonants are transcribed with **◌ʳ** to reflect their rhoticity; their old non-rhotic counterparts have largely merged with them.

Another requirement was to make contrasts not found in the surrounding the languages. The rhotics already cover this, but so does the presence of the voiced fricatives, to some extant. Also, so far as I'm aware, none of my initial sourcelangs contrast geminate consonants at all. The Chonan languages might, but I imagine that's mostly because they allow a lot of clustering, presumably allowing for gemination in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vowels**

||Front|Back|
|:-|:-|:-|
|High|ɪ**ː**|ʊ**ː**|
|Mid|ɛ|ɔ|
|Low|æ**ː**|a|

This can be analysed as a 3 vowel system with /e/, /o/, and /a/ with length wherein the short counterparts are lowered and the long counterparts are raised. Making most of the vowels lax was intentional and takes cues from many of my initial sourcelangs.

&amp;#x200B;

*Allophony and Diphthong Resolution:*

Only short vowels may appear after uvulars, and long vowels will become their short counterparts should the come to appear after a uvular. Meanwhile, only long vowels may appear after /ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**/ in certain contexts. Historic *\*j* merged with /ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**/ and only long vowels may follow this segment.

Varamm does not allow for diphthongs. Historically, rising diphthongs would have been resolved with a short vowel plus \[j\] or \[w\] but these sounds have shifted. Now, rising rounded diphthongs are realised as short vowels + /v/ and rising unrounded diphthongs as short vowels + /ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**/. Meanwhile, falling and centring diphthongs are realised as long vowels + /ɾ/; this was motivated by the difference between rhotic and non-rhotic speakers of English (compare *'near'* \[nɪə\] vs. \[nɪr\]) and under influence from Tokétok.

&amp;#x200B;

**Phonotactics, Cluster Restrictions, and Resolutions**

The challenge stipulated that there must be strict cluster restrictions. I'll spare you the chart and summarise it along with the general phonotactics.

The basic, maximal syllable structure is CCVK wherein both V and K can be long. K here represents a class of consonants that includes sonorant and retroflex consonants and /v/, the latter two of which evolved from sonorants in this position. Since only K may be geminate, geminate consonants may only appear syllable finally. In general, onset clusters must appear in this order: nasal - stop - fricative - approximant; like classes of consonants may not appear together. The specifics of what clusters are legal or how they resolve are as follows (for this context, I am not including the retroflex consonants under rhotics):

* Nasal consonants can appear before any homorganic consonants, barring the approximants and dorsal fricatives.
   * Before approximants, both /m/ and /ŋ/ can appear, but not /n/.
* Ejectives may not appear before anything.
* Plain stops may appear before /v/ (barring /p/), voiceless fricatives, and approximants.
   * /p/ + dorsal fricatives resolve to /p/.
   * Dorsal stops + dorsal fricatives resolve to the fricative.
* /ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**/ may appear before /v/, /ʀ/, and /w/, and it takes over any other subsequent consonants, barring an illegal /l/.
* /v/ may appear before any approximant.
* Sibilants may only appear before rhotics and they resolve to retroflex sibilants.
* Dorsal fricatives + rhotics resolve to /ʀ/.
* Dorsal fricatives + /l/ resolve to /ɹ̝/, and an epenthetic vowel is inserted where necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prosody**

Primary stress in Varamm is determined with morae. Onsets carry no weight, short vowels and codas carry a weight of 1, and long vowels and codas carry a weight of 2. As such, a word in Varamm could theoretically have up to 4 morae, but this is rare. Primary stress falls on the antepenultimate mora, wherever that may lie in the word. Secondary stress is trochaic and right-branching and defaults to the first syllable of a word so long as it's not too close to the primary stressed syllable. Should the word have a heavy prefix (with 3-4 morae), then that prefix will take secondary stress, but only if the initial syllable of the root is not also heavy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reduplication**

Varamm employs Malagasy style reduplication as part of its grammar. This involves reduplicating the initial mora of a root, appending it as a prefix, and possibly metathesising the initial cluster of the root or fortifying the initial consonant of the root. This metathesis occurs with many prefixes and only occurs when the cluster initially exists as a CK cluster and the resulting KC cluster is legal. The fortition patterns are as follows:

|Lenis|Fortis|
|:-|:-|
|l|z̪|
|ɾ|z̪|
|z̪|ʐ**ʳ**|
|s̪|ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**|
|ʂ**ʳ**|ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**|
|w|v|
|x|k|
|h|p|

Another requirement of the challenge was to have a gaping gap in phonology and morphology. My phonology gap exists in the fortition patterns, however it's not the widest of gaps. If you consider that \[x\] has merged with \[h\], then in spoken language \[h\] can fortify to either \[k\] and \[p\] depending on the word, and \[ʐʳ\] doesn't fortify despite that the other sibilants do. I don't really care that I strictly meet all the requirements anymore, but they did still guide me.

&amp;#x200B;

# Romanisation

I developed two similar orthographies for Varamm, hereby termed long-form and short-form. The long-form uses digraphs where the short-form uses diacritics. In general, I usually use a mix: I prefer the short-form vowels and the long-form consonants. Using short-form consonants would be mostly for use in a scribal shorthand; using long-form vowels would be mostly for use in teaching. Where there are two conventions in use, they shall appear as \[long-form\]/\[short-form\].

|Graph|Value|Graph|Value|Graph|Value|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|a|a|m|m|s|s̪|

|l|l̪|rr/r̂|ɹ̝|zr/ẑ|ʐ**ʳ**|

Monographs are doubled when geminate, and ⟨sr⟩, ⟨tr⟩, and ⟨zr⟩ written as ⟨ssr⟩, ⟨ttr⟩, and ⟨zzr⟩ when geminate. My use of ⟨î⟩ and ⟨û⟩, despite note having ⟨i⟩ and ⟨u⟩, is mostly stylistic and it serves as a greater visual reminder of their qualities. The ⟨**◌̂**⟩ would've evolved from a superstoried ⟨r⟩, similar to how ⟨ñ⟩ evolved, before being used as a more general diacritic. Also having both ⟨g⟩ and ⟨j⟩ for /x/ is mostly because I couldn't decide which I preferred so I figured I'd just use both and ascribe the more slender one of the two to short-form.

&amp;#x200B;

# Morphology

**Nominal Morphonology**

Varamm distinguishes 4 classes, 3 cases, and 3 numbers. The latter 2 and definiteness are discussed below, but the class system will be discussed later as part of semantics.

&amp;#x200B;

*Cases:*

The basic erg/abs case system evolved from an old set of particles that connected the verb with the noun directly following it. Given that Varamm is VOS, this resulted in a marked absolutive, one of the requirements of the challenge. The cases are marked by a prefix that supersedes any plural marking (another gaping gap as previously mentioned) and they agree for noun class. The absolutive prefixes are **qo-**, **la-**, **se-**, and **zo-** at their simplest, but they force metathesis of following CK clusters and combine with initial vowels in different ways.

Meanwhile, the genitive case evolved from a set of pronouns which became procliticised. These also agree for class with the forms **l(e)-**, **nk(o)-**, **s(a)-**, and **r(e)-**. Meanwhile, the genitive pronouns encliticise onto the nouns that they possess.

&amp;#x200B;

*Numbers:*

Plurality is formed through the reduplication system mentioned above. As just mentioned, since plurality marking is superseded in the absolutive, these arguments are largely unmarked for number. However, some nouns exist as natural duals for those that come in pairs, such as horns or shoes. These words can take the singulative suffix **-gû**, which supersedes any definiteness marking, and their plural forms pluralise the pair, not the individual.

&amp;#x200B;

*Definiteness:*

Similarly to other nominal marking, definite markers agree for class. These are suffixes and are often needed in certain contexts to distinguish between different, otherwise unmarked classes, namely in possessive and copular constructions. Most of the definite suffixes change form after a vowel, but their usual forms are **-amm**, **-etr**, **-gî**, and **-arr**.

&amp;#x200B;

*Demonstratives and Deixis:*

Varamm distinguishes 4 degrees of deixis in its demonstratives: proximate, medial, immediate, and distal. Proximate describes things near to the speaker, immediate near to the listener, medial between them, and distal far away from them both. The demonstratives also agree for class. I have yet to decide how/where exactly they appear with nouns, but they are relevant to the verb system:

&amp;#x200B;

||Proximate|Medial|Immediate|Distal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Summital|katr|trerr|ngarr|rerr|
|Arboreal|karr|tvetr|ngetr|retr|
|Basal|kav|twa|ngav|rav|
|Transversal|gre|tre|ram|ren|

&amp;#x200B;

**Verbal Morphology**

Verbs mark 2 aspects, 6 tenses, agree for subject plurality, and take an obligatory post-verbal demonstrative to mark tense and subject class agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

*Aspects:*

Varamm uses what I call inverse perfectivity to mark aspect on its verbs. As the name might suggest, the 2 aspects are perfective and imperfective, but rather than either being a marked form, different verbs have either aspect as their default aspect and are marked for the other. What makes this an inverse system is that the marker is the same for both. The marker is **ne(t)-**.

What governs a verbs default aspect is based on a requirement from the challenge to have verbs treated differently depending on lexical aspect or aktionsart. I settled on distinguishing manner verbs from result verbs. Manner verbs describe a process, how something is done, whilst result verbs describe an outcome, what came of what was done. As you might expect, manner verbs are imperfective by default, and result verbs are perfective.

To illustrate this concept, consider the verbs 'to wipe' and 'to break' in English. 'To wipe' describes a manner of cleaning something off, for example a window, and you can quite easily actively be in the process of wiping a window clean. Meanwhile, 'to break' describes a result, and it's quite difficult to actively be in the process of breaking a window: the window can be broken or unbroken, but there really isn't an appreciable in-between state where the window is in the process of breaking. All this to say that 'to wipe' would sooner be used imperfectively, and 'to break' to perfectively: you'd sooner say ""I'm currently wiping the window"" than ""I'm currently breaking the window""; likewise, you'd sooner say ""I've broken the window"" than ""I've wiped the window"".

Additionally, Varamm also a negative prefix, **al-**, that metathesises with the inverse perfectivity marker to form the prefix **anle(t)-**.

Finally, Varamm has a constituent marker, a verb formed used in subordinate clauses, and it supersedes the perfectivity marking. This fulfills a previously mentioned requirement of the challenge to have a gaping gap in two of phonology, conjugation, and declension. Since subordinate verbs cannot take perfectivity marking, subordinate clauses must be in the grammatical aspect that corresponds to their main verbs lexical aspect.

&amp;#x200B;

*Tenses and the Wheel of Time:*

Varamm marks 6 tenses and has a cyclical concept of time. These tenses are past, present, future, distant, immediate past, and immediate future. These tenses are marked using demonstratives wherein the deixis is used as a conceptual metaphor for time and the speaker and listener occupy nearby points on the circle of time.

The present is considered to be a point in time between the speaker and the listener, and as such is marked using the medial demonstrative. Therefore, if the present is between the speaker and the listener, then the past and future must be on either side. In the case of Varamm, a point nearer to the speaker than the listener is considered in the past, and a point nearer to the listener than the speaker is considered in the future; as such, the past is marked with a proximate demonstrative and the future with an immediate. This stems from the idea of the speaker gifting something to the listener: the gift was (past) with the speaker, and it will (future) be with the listener. Finally, the distal demonstrative marks a time far away from the now, either past or future; if time is cyclical, then the distant past and distant future are the same, and represent a point on the circle opposite to the present.

The immediate past and immediate future are marked using a proximate and a medial demonstrative respectively, but the verb takes an additional contiguous marker. Both these tenses refer to moments immediately adjacent to the moment being talked about, but without any sort of time descriptor they can also refer to moments immediately adjacent to the moment of speech.

This whole system was inspired by Rapa Nui's use of post-verbal demonstratives.

&amp;#x200B;

*Subject Agreement:*

Verbs agree with their subjects for both plurality and class. Plurality agreement is done through root reduplication. In the case of intransitive sentences, wherein the subject takes an absolutive marker that supersedes its plurality marking, this verbal agreement is the only way to discern it's plurality. Meanwhile, class agreement is done through the post-verbal demonstrative used for the tense system: the form this demonstrative takes must agree in class with the subject. For this agreement, 2nd person pronouns trigger transversal agreement, and 1st person can trigger summital or arboreal agreement depending on clusivity/matedness (this will be discussed together with the noun classes below).

&amp;#x200B;

# Syntax

Varamm has a basic VOS word order, as previously mentioned, but it's possessive and copular constructions are non-verbal and don't follow this same word order. The latter of these 2 constructions fulfills the challenge requirement to not have a non-verbal, non-zero, non-particle copula.

&amp;#x200B;

*Possessive Construction:*

Possessive constructions follow the format of ""\[possessee\] \[genitive pronoun\] (\[possessor\])"". This is similar to a zero-copula construction wherein simply be juxtaposing the possessee with a genitive pronoun, which can be read as an adjectival form, the meaning of possession is expressed. The possessor is optional in this case but appears phrase finally like a subject would in a full sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

*Copular Construction:*

The copular constriction follows the format of ""\[copular pronoun\] \[predicate\] (\[subject\])"". This was based on the Hebrew copular pronoun construction wherein literally translating ""David is the thief"" would render ""David he the thief"". In theory this could read as a zero-copula if you omit the subject or the copular pronoun since the copular pronoun is identical to the ergative pronoun, but I'm happy saying this still doesn't quite fail the requirement because the pronoun is required for a copular reading. Also, I imagine that using a zero-copula with pure juxtaposition would use the absolutive pronoun.

&amp;#x200B;

# Semantics

Here I'll discuss the noun class system. I'm discussing it under semantics because so far my best descriptor for this system is to call it ""semantic noun class"". I have no idea how appropriate this is, so if you can think of a better name I'm all ears.

&amp;#x200B;

**Noun Class**

Varamm has 4 noun classes: summital, arboreal, basal, and transversal. Each of these prototypically describes a noun's origin. The speakers of Varamm live in the mountains and divide the world into 3 broad zones: the summit, the slopes, and the plains. These 3 zones correspond to the first 3 noun classes. The final noun class, transversal, describes nouns that regularly move between these zones.

Whilst the noun classes describe noun origin, each of the classes has also come to acquire certain metaphorical connotations. Summital nouns describe things that are holy, or virtuous, or awe-inspiring, as well as things that are tall or volant. Arboreal nouns describe things that are mundane, or familiar, part of every day life. Basal nouns describe things that are distant or foreign, or low down, or have to do with the ocean. There's also a rough diminutive/augmentative split or tribal/civil split between the arboreal and basal nouns: a homestead might be arboreal, whilst a metropolis is basal, for example. Finally, transversal nouns describe things that are related to trade and commerce.

Now, why I refer to this system as semantic noun class is because any noun can treated as any class. Nouns occupy broad or loose semantic fields and the agreement patterns they trigger narrow their meaning. Not every noun has a canonical definition in every class, but many of them do. My favourite example of this system in action is for the word **grasan** which occupies the semantic field for *'arboriforme*'. When treated as an arboreal noun, **grasan** naturally then means *'tree'*. If we treat it as a summital noun, it proceeds to take on a meaning of tree-like lichens (specifically foliose and some fruticose lichens). Similarly, when treated basally, it means *'coral'*, arguably the tree of the ocean, kelp aside. And when treated transversally? It means *'fossil tree'* because they are transverse to rock strata.

&amp;#x200B;

**Matedness**

I'm including this here because it's related to noun class. Varamm has a clusivity distinction in its first person pronouns that extends to the singular forms, at least after a fasion. In the singular, this clusivity distinction lines up to this concept of matedness: the unmated 1st person singular pronouns are used when the speaker is not married, and naturally the mated forms are used for when they are. This also extends to a set of 1st person dual pronouns that are only used when mated. Both 1st person dual pronouns refer to oneself and one's spouse, but the inclusive is used when addressing one's spouse, and the exclusive is when addressing someone else.

As mentioned previously, the 1st and 2nd person pronouns trigger agreement patterns just like the 3rd person pronouns would. 2nd person pronouns always trigger transversal agreement, whilst 1st person pronouns trigger arboreal and summital agreement based on matedness/clusivity. The unmated and inclusive forms trigger summital agreement, these forms being considered more virtuous, whilst the mated and exclusive forms trigger arboreal agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

# Test Sentences

One of the stipulations of the original challenge was to translate 5 sentences to put the syntax to the test. I'll try for these to be illustrative of all that I've shared above but I am still lacking in vocabulary to properly exhibit everything.

# Afterword

If you read any part of this, I hope that you enjoyed or that you learned something new. If you have questions, comments, or curiosities, please leave them below. If anything was unclear, or you caught any mistakes, I'll be happy to clear anything up. And if you have any critiques, I'd love to hear other perspectives on this conlang. This conlang has very quickly become my favourite, if not second to Tokétok. I only maintain 3 at the moment, but Varamm has totally eclipsed Naŧoš in every way. It still certainly needs some work, and there are some things I'm still working on that I did not touch on here, but it by far and away gets the lion's share of my attention these days.

I imagine I shall return with updates on Varamm as I canonise more of the syntax, the tone-tag modal system, or the pitch accent system I've inadvertently begun to develop. Until then:

Thank you for paying this some attention.","Varamm: The Voice of the Wind, and a very slow speedlang","This'll be a long one, so those of you who are so kind as to read, or even skim, just a portion of this through, bear with me.

# Background

Varamm started as an attempt at [Speedlang Challenge 8½](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/oxd2m8/speedlang_challenge_8½/) by u/Anhilare last August. I put in about 10 days work and got maybe 2/3 of the way to being able to translate some sentences before I was due to move into my new apartment for school and was too busy to finish in time. I took a hiatus of a couple months to get settled into school life and have been working on it like any of my other conlangs ever since: slow and relaxed. I finally think Varamm is to a point that I'm happy to share it. Given that the challenge had some specific requirements, I'll intersperse how I addressed them throughout this introduction to Varamm. Firstly....

# Locale and Influences

The challenge specifically outlined that the speedlang was to be an isolated language far in the mountains of any range of our choosing and that the surrounding natlangs had to have some influence on the speedlang. I chose the wet (southern) Andes as my mountain range. My style or preferred method of conlanging already leans pretty heavily on stealing from natlangs and marrying their different features together into something unique so I set about making notes of the surrounding natlangs: primarly Mapuche, Quechua as well as a little Spanish and Tehuelche &amp; Ona. I also included Rapa Nui in the list as a wild card due to it's connections (albeit colonial) with Peru and by extension Quechua.

After I picked up the conlang again post school move, I also included Malagasy to round out my Oceanic influence, some Hebrew and Arabic, and some Georgian as another wildcard from another mountain range. Barring Malagasy, I also have friends who can speak these languages so I can pick their brain should I ever find myself lacking in resources. The Malagasy and Semitic influences are mostly there for something for me to lean on syntactically, and Georgian mostly exists as a source for me to steal words from nowadays.

Due to this shift away from the speedlang and turning this into a personal artlang, Varamm has also since been subsumed into the conworld that my other major conlangs all exist in. Varamm now occupies a mountainous region neighbouring Tokétok's vast temperate rainforests, but they're wholly unrelated to each other, barring the beginnings of a sprachbund. I had had a conlang planned for this region for ages and the region was inhabited by a race of derived caprinae (goats). Some of the initial notes I had on this culture have weedled their way into Varamm.

# Phonology

**Consonants**

||Labial|Dental|Alveolar|Retroflex|Velar|Uvular|Glottal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nasal|m m**ː**|n̪ n̪**ː**||(ɳ)|ŋ ŋ**ː**|(ɴ)||
|Plain Stop|p|t̪||ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ** ʈ͡ʂ**ʳː**|k|q|(ʔ)|
|Ejective Stop|p'|t̪'|||k'|q'||
|Unvoiced fricative||s̪||ʂ**ʳ** ʂ**ʳː**|x||h|
|Voiced fricative|v v**ː**|z̪|ɹ̝|ʐ**ʳ** ʐ**ʳː**||||
|Vibrant|||ɾ|(ɽ)||ʀ||
|Approximant||l̪ l̪**ː**|||w|||

*Allophony:*

* \[ɳ\] is an allophone of \[n\] and \[ɴ\] of \[ŋ\] before their respective place series.
* \[ɽ\] only really still exists for conservative speakers, it was the original rhotic whence the retroflex and alveolar series evolved.
* \[ʔ\] appears before otherwise vowel initial words but has no bearing on morphophonology.
* \[x\] has largely merged with \[h\] but the contrast is still maintained in the orthography and fortition patterns as you'll see below.
* \[ɹ̝\] can be geminate or co-occur with a tap: \[ɾ͡ɹ̝̊\]. It evolved from the old geminate \[ɾ **\~** ɽ\] and only patterns as a geminate.
* \[ʀ\] patterns as a geminate in coda position.
* Word final geminates degeminate but still affect prosody.

&amp;#x200B;

*Rhotics and Contrasts:*

One of the requirements of the initial speedlang challenge was to have more than 2 rhotics. Varamm arguably has 3-6 rhotics, depending on how you analyse it: /ɾ/, /ɹ̝/ &amp; /ʀ/, and /ʂ**ʳ**/, /ʐ**ʳ**/, and /ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**/. They all evolved from the old rhotic in some way, largely still pattern in the same way, and are phonemically contrastive from each other. The latter 3 retroflex consonants are transcribed with **◌ʳ** to reflect their rhoticity; their old non-rhotic counterparts have largely merged with them.

Another requirement was to make contrasts not found in the surrounding the languages. The rhotics already cover this, but so does the presence of the voiced fricatives, to some extant. Also, so far as I'm aware, none of my initial sourcelangs contrast geminate consonants at all. The Chonan languages might, but I imagine that's mostly because they allow a lot of clustering, presumably allowing for gemination in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vowels**

||Front|Back|
|:-|:-|:-|
|High|ɪ**ː**|ʊ**ː**|
|Mid|ɛ|ɔ|
|Low|æ**ː**|a|

This can be analysed as a 3 vowel system with /e/, /o/, and /a/ with length wherein the short counterparts are lowered and the long counterparts are raised. Making most of the vowels lax was intentional and takes cues from many of my initial sourcelangs.

&amp;#x200B;

*Allophony and Diphthong Resolution:*

Only short vowels may appear after uvulars, and long vowels will become their short counterparts should the come to appear after a uvular. Meanwhile, only long vowels may appear after /ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**/ in certain contexts. Historic *\*j* merged with /ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**/ and only long vowels may follow this segment.

Varamm does not allow for diphthongs. Historically, rising diphthongs would have been resolved with a short vowel plus \[j\] or \[w\] but these sounds have shifted. Now, rising rounded diphthongs are realised as short vowels + /v/ and rising unrounded diphthongs as short vowels + /ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**/. Meanwhile, falling and centring diphthongs are realised as long vowels + /ɾ/; this was motivated by the difference between rhotic and non-rhotic speakers of English (compare *'near'* \[nɪə\] vs. \[nɪr\]) and under influence from Tokétok.

&amp;#x200B;

**Phonotactics, Cluster Restrictions, and Resolutions**

The challenge stipulated that there must be strict cluster restrictions. I'll spare you the chart and summarise it along with the general phonotactics.

The basic, maximal syllable structure is CCVK wherein both V and K can be long. K here represents a class of consonants that includes sonorant and retroflex consonants and /v/, the latter two of which evolved from sonorants in this position. Since only K may be geminate, geminate consonants may only appear syllable finally. In general, onset clusters must appear in this order: nasal - stop - fricative - approximant; like classes of consonants may not appear together. The specifics of what clusters are legal or how they resolve are as follows (for this context, I am not including the retroflex consonants under rhotics):

* Nasal consonants can appear before any homorganic consonants, barring the approximants and dorsal fricatives.
   * Before approximants, both /m/ and /ŋ/ can appear, but not /n/.
* Ejectives may not appear before anything.
* Plain stops may appear before /v/ (barring /p/), voiceless fricatives, and approximants.
   * /p/ + dorsal fricatives resolve to /p/.
   * Dorsal stops + dorsal fricatives resolve to the fricative.
* /ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**/ may appear before /v/, /ʀ/, and /w/, and it takes over any other subsequent consonants, barring an illegal /l/.
* /v/ may appear before any approximant.
* Sibilants may only appear before rhotics and they resolve to retroflex sibilants.
* Dorsal fricatives + rhotics resolve to /ʀ/.
* Dorsal fricatives + /l/ resolve to /ɹ̝/, and an epenthetic vowel is inserted where necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prosody**

Primary stress in Varamm is determined with morae. Onsets carry no weight, short vowels and codas carry a weight of 1, and long vowels and codas carry a weight of 2. As such, a word in Varamm could theoretically have up to 4 morae, but this is rare. Primary stress falls on the antepenultimate mora, wherever that may lie in the word. Secondary stress is trochaic and right-branching and defaults to the first syllable of a word so long as it's not too close to the primary stressed syllable. Should the word have a heavy prefix (with 3-4 morae), then that prefix will take secondary stress, but only if the initial syllable of the root is not also heavy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reduplication**

Varamm employs Malagasy style reduplication as part of its grammar. This involves reduplicating the initial mora of a root, appending it as a prefix, and possibly metathesising the initial cluster of the root or fortifying the initial consonant of the root. This metathesis occurs with many prefixes and only occurs when the cluster initially exists as a CK cluster and the resulting KC cluster is legal. The fortition patterns are as follows:

|Lenis|Fortis|
|:-|:-|
|l|z̪|
|ɾ|z̪|
|z̪|ʐ**ʳ**|
|s̪|ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**|
|ʂ**ʳ**|ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**|
|w|v|
|x|k|
|h|p|

Another requirement of the challenge was to have a gaping gap in phonology and morphology. My phonology gap exists in the fortition patterns, however it's not the widest of gaps. If you consider that \[x\] has merged with \[h\], then in spoken language \[h\] can fortify to either \[k\] and \[p\] depending on the word, and \[ʐʳ\] doesn't fortify despite that the other sibilants do. I don't really care that I strictly meet all the requirements anymore, but they did still guide me.

&amp;#x200B;

# Romanisation

I developed two similar orthographies for Varamm, hereby termed long-form and short-form. The long-form uses digraphs where the short-form uses diacritics. In general, I usually use a mix: I prefer the short-form vowels and the long-form consonants. Using short-form consonants would be mostly for use in a scribal shorthand; using long-form vowels would be mostly for use in teaching. Where there are two conventions in use, they shall appear as \[long-form\]/\[short-form\].

|Graph|Value|Graph|Value|Graph|Value|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|a|a|m|m|s|s̪|
|aa/â|æ**ː**|n|n, ŋ/\_K|sr/ŝ|ʂ**ʳ**|
|e|ɛ|ng/n̂|ŋ|t|t|
|g/j|x|o|ɔ|t'|tʼ|
|gr/ĝ|ʀ|p|p|tr/t̂|ʈ͡ʂ**ʳ**|

|k|k|q'|qʼ|w|w|
|k'|kʼ|r|ɾ|z|z̪|
|l|l̪|rr/r̂|ɹ̝|zr/ẑ|ʐ**ʳ**|

Monographs are doubled when geminate, and ⟨sr⟩, ⟨tr⟩, and ⟨zr⟩ written as ⟨ssr⟩, ⟨ttr⟩, and ⟨zzr⟩ when geminate. My use of ⟨î⟩ and ⟨û⟩, despite note having ⟨i⟩ and ⟨u⟩, is mostly stylistic and it serves as a greater visual reminder of their qualities. The ⟨**◌̂**⟩ would've evolved from a superstoried ⟨r⟩, similar to how ⟨ñ⟩ evolved, before being used as a more general diacritic. Also having both ⟨g⟩ and ⟨j⟩ for /x/ is mostly because I couldn't decide which I preferred so I figured I'd just use both and ascribe the more slender one of the two to short-form.

&amp;#x200B;

# Morphology

**Nominal Morphonology**

Varamm distinguishes 4 classes, 3 cases, and 3 numbers. The latter 2 and definiteness are discussed below, but the class system will be discussed later as part of semantics.

&amp;#x200B;

*Cases:*

The basic erg/abs case system evolved from an old set of particles that connected the verb with the noun directly following it. Given that Varamm is VOS, this resulted in a marked absolutive, one of the requirements of the challenge. The cases are marked by a prefix that supersedes any plural marking (another gaping gap as previously mentioned) and they agree for noun class. The absolutive prefixes are **qo-**, **la-**, **se-**, and **zo-** at their simplest, but they force metathesis of following CK clusters and combine with initial vowels in different ways.

Meanwhile, the genitive case evolved from a set of pronouns which became procliticised. These also agree for class with the forms **l(e)-**, **nk(o)-**, **s(a)-**, and **r(e)-**. Meanwhile, the genitive pronouns encliticise onto the nouns that they possess.

&amp;#x200B;

*Numbers:*

Plurality is formed through the reduplication system mentioned above. As just mentioned, since plurality marking is superseded in the absolutive, these arguments are largely unmarked for number. However, some nouns exist as natural duals for those that come in pairs, such as horns or shoes. These words can take the singulative suffix **-gû**, which supersedes any definiteness marking, and their plural forms pluralise the pair, not the individual.

&amp;#x200B;

*Definiteness:*

Similarly to other nominal marking, definite markers agree for class. These are suffixes and are often needed in certain contexts to distinguish between different, otherwise unmarked classes, namely in possessive and copular constructions. Most of the definite suffixes change form after a vowel, but their usual forms are **-amm**, **-etr**, **-gî**, and **-arr**.

&amp;#x200B;

*Demonstratives and Deixis:*

Varamm distinguishes 4 degrees of deixis in its demonstratives: proximate, medial, immediate, and distal. Proximate describes things near to the speaker, immediate near to the listener, medial between them, and distal far away from them both. The demonstratives also agree for class. I have yet to decide how/where exactly they appear with nouns, but they are relevant to the verb system:

&amp;#x200B;

||Proximate|Medial|Immediate|Distal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Summital|katr|trerr|ngarr|rerr|
|Arboreal|karr|tvetr|ngetr|retr|
|Basal|kav|twa|ngav|rav|
|Transversal|gre|tre|ram|ren|

&amp;#x200B;

**Verbal Morphology**

Verbs mark 2 aspects, 6 tenses, agree for subject plurality, and take an obligatory post-verbal demonstrative to mark tense and subject class agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

*Aspects:*

Varamm uses what I call inverse perfectivity to mark aspect on its verbs. As the name might suggest, the 2 aspects are perfective and imperfective, but rather than either being a marked form, different verbs have either aspect as their default aspect and are marked for the other. What makes this an inverse system is that the marker is the same for both. The marker is **ne(t)-**.

What governs a verbs default aspect is based on a requirement from the challenge to have verbs treated differently depending on lexical aspect or aktionsart. I settled on distinguishing manner verbs from result verbs. Manner verbs describe a process, how something is done, whilst result verbs describe an outcome, what came of what was done. As you might expect, manner verbs are imperfective by default, and result verbs are perfective.

To illustrate this concept, consider the verbs 'to wipe' and 'to break' in English. 'To wipe' describes a manner of cleaning something off, for example a window, and you can quite easily actively be in the process of wiping a window clean. Meanwhile, 'to break' describes a result, and it's quite difficult to actively be in the process of breaking a window: the window can be broken or unbroken, but there really isn't an appreciable in-between state where the window is in the process of breaking. All this to say that 'to wipe' would sooner be used imperfectively, and 'to break' to perfectively: you'd sooner say ""I'm currently wiping the window"" than ""I'm currently breaking the window""; likewise, you'd sooner say ""I've broken the window"" than ""I've wiped the window"".

Additionally, Varamm also a negative prefix, **al-**, that metathesises with the inverse perfectivity marker to form the prefix **anle(t)-**.

Finally, Varamm has a constituent marker, a verb formed used in subordinate clauses, and it supersedes the perfectivity marking. This fulfills a previously mentioned requirement of the challenge to have a gaping gap in two of phonology, conjugation, and declension. Since subordinate verbs cannot take perfectivity marking, subordinate clauses must be in the grammatical aspect that corresponds to their main verbs lexical aspect.

&amp;#x200B;

*Tenses and the Wheel of Time:*

Varamm marks 6 tenses and has a cyclical concept of time. These tenses are past, present, future, distant, immediate past, and immediate future. These tenses are marked using demonstratives wherein the deixis is used as a conceptual metaphor for time and the speaker and listener occupy nearby points on the circle of time.

The present is considered to be a point in time between the speaker and the listener, and as such is marked using the medial demonstrative. Therefore, if the present is between the speaker and the listener, then the past and future must be on either side. In the case of Varamm, a point nearer to the speaker than the listener is considered in the past, and a point nearer to the listener than the speaker is considered in the future; as such, the past is marked with a proximate demonstrative and the future with an immediate. This stems from the idea of the speaker gifting something to the listener: the gift was (past) with the speaker, and it will (future) be with the listener. Finally, the distal demonstrative marks a time far away from the now, either past or future; if time is cyclical, then the distant past and distant future are the same, and represent a point on the circle opposite to the present.

The immediate past and immediate future are marked using a proximate and a medial demonstrative respectively, but the verb takes an additional contiguous marker. Both these tenses refer to moments immediately adjacent to the moment being talked about, but without any sort of time descriptor they can also refer to moments immediately adjacent to the moment of speech.

This whole system was inspired by Rapa Nui's use of post-verbal demonstratives.

&amp;#x200B;

*Subject Agreement:*

Verbs agree with their subjects for both plurality and class. Plurality agreement is done through root reduplication. In the case of intransitive sentences, wherein the subject takes an absolutive marker that supersedes its plurality marking, this verbal agreement is the only way to discern it's plurality. Meanwhile, class agreement is done through the post-verbal demonstrative used for the tense system: the form this demonstrative takes must agree in class with the subject. For this agreement, 2nd person pronouns trigger transversal agreement, and 1st person can trigger summital or arboreal agreement depending on clusivity/matedness (this will be discussed together with the noun classes below).

&amp;#x200B;

# Syntax

Varamm has a basic VOS word order, as previously mentioned, but it's possessive and copular constructions are non-verbal and don't follow this same word order. The latter of these 2 constructions fulfills the challenge requirement to not have a non-verbal, non-zero, non-particle copula.

&amp;#x200B;

*Possessive Construction:*

Possessive constructions follow the format of ""\[possessee\] \[genitive pronoun\] (\[possessor\])"". This is similar to a zero-copula construction wherein simply be juxtaposing the possessee with a genitive pronoun, which can be read as an adjectival form, the meaning of possession is expressed. The possessor is optional in this case but appears phrase finally like a subject would in a full sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

*Copular Construction:*

The copular constriction follows the format of ""\[copular pronoun\] \[predicate\] (\[subject\])"". This was based on the Hebrew copular pronoun construction wherein literally translating ""David is the thief"" would render ""David he the thief"". In theory this could read as a zero-copula if you omit the subject or the copular pronoun since the copular pronoun is identical to the ergative pronoun, but I'm happy saying this still doesn't quite fail the requirement because the pronoun is required for a copular reading. Also, I imagine that using a zero-copula with pure juxtaposition would use the absolutive pronoun.

&amp;#x200B;

# Semantics

Here I'll discuss the noun class system. I'm discussing it under semantics because so far my best descriptor for this system is to call it ""semantic noun class"". I have no idea how appropriate this is, so if you can think of a better name I'm all ears.

&amp;#x200B;

**Noun Class**

Varamm has 4 noun classes: summital, arboreal, basal, and transversal. Each of these prototypically describes a noun's origin. The speakers of Varamm live in the mountains and divide the world into 3 broad zones: the summit, the slopes, and the plains. These 3 zones correspond to the first 3 noun classes. The final noun class, transversal, describes nouns that regularly move between these zones.

Whilst the noun classes describe noun origin, each of the classes has also come to acquire certain metaphorical connotations. Summital nouns describe things that are holy, or virtuous, or awe-inspiring, as well as things that are tall or volant. Arboreal nouns describe things that are mundane, or familiar, part of every day life. Basal nouns describe things that are distant or foreign, or low down, or have to do with the ocean. There's also a rough diminutive/augmentative split or tribal/civil split between the arboreal and basal nouns: a homestead might be arboreal, whilst a metropolis is basal, for example. Finally, transversal nouns describe things that are related to trade and commerce.

Now, why I refer to this system as semantic noun class is because any noun can treated as any class. Nouns occupy broad or loose semantic fields and the agreement patterns they trigger narrow their meaning. Not every noun has a canonical definition in every class, but many of them do. My favourite example of this system in action is for the word **grasan** which occupies the semantic field for *'arboriforme*'. When treated as an arboreal noun, **grasan** naturally then means *'tree'*. If we treat it as a summital noun, it proceeds to take on a meaning of tree-like lichens (specifically foliose and some fruticose lichens). Similarly, when treated basally, it means *'coral'*, arguably the tree of the ocean, kelp aside. And when treated transversally? It means *'fossil tree'* because they are transverse to rock strata.

&amp;#x200B;

**Matedness**

I'm including this here because it's related to noun class. Varamm has a clusivity distinction in its first person pronouns that extends to the singular forms, at least after a fasion. In the singular, this clusivity distinction lines up to this concept of matedness: the unmated 1st person singular pronouns are used when the speaker is not married, and naturally the mated forms are used for when they are. This also extends to a set of 1st person dual pronouns that are only used when mated. Both 1st person dual pronouns refer to oneself and one's spouse, but the inclusive is used when addressing one's spouse, and the exclusive is when addressing someone else.

As mentioned previously, the 1st and 2nd person pronouns trigger agreement patterns just like the 3rd person pronouns would. 2nd person pronouns always trigger transversal agreement, whilst 1st person pronouns trigger arboreal and summital agreement based on matedness/clusivity. The unmated and inclusive forms trigger summital agreement, these forms being considered more virtuous, whilst the mated and exclusive forms trigger arboreal agreement.

# Test Sentences

One of the stipulations of the original challenge was to translate 5 sentences to put the syntax to the test. I'll try for these to be illustrative of all that I've shared above but I am still lacking in vocabulary to properly exhibit everything.

# Afterword

If you read any part of this, I hope that you enjoyed or that you learned something new. If you have questions, comments, or curiosities, please leave them below. If anything was unclear, or you caught any mistakes, I'll be happy to clear anything up. And if you have any critiques, I'd love to hear other perspectives on this conlang. This conlang has very quickly become my favourite, if not second to Tokétok. I only maintain 3 at the moment, but Varamm has totally eclipsed Naŧoš in every way. It still certainly needs some work, and there are some things I'm still working on that I did not touch on here, but it by far and away gets the lion's share of my attention these days.

I imagine I shall return with updates on Varamm as I canonise more of the syntax, the tone-tag modal system, or the pitch accent system I've inadvertently begun to develop. Until then:

1382,0,"I recently created yet another conworld. There are two main languages spoken in this world. One is a pseudo-conlang that I'm only using to generate names of people and places. The other, which this post focuses on, is a language spoken by a type of monster called Shades. Their primary mode of communication is non-verbal, but they do have a primitive spoken language that is primarily used for expressing things that are difficult to express in their primary mode of communication. Most notably, it is used in identifying individuals, a.k.a. names.

**Anatomy**

Their oral and respiratory anatomy is pretty similar to human anatomy. However, they lack vocal cords and therefore are unable to produce voiced sounds. Also, they use a lot of fricatives and some trills, which would be pretty hard to differentiate to human ears (honestly, ɕ, ɬ, and ʎ̝̊ all sound the same to me). Also they can't open their mouths very widely, so there are no open vowels.

Stops are always aspirated.

\[Question\] I'm using this conlang as an opportunity to mess with norms of naturalistic conlanging, but I do want it to seem like a naturalistic conlang in the sense that it arose naturally from Shade communication. Aside from the utter lack of nasals, is there anything that stands out as being particularly unnaturalistic here?

**Vowels**

||Front|Back|

\[Question\] How do I spell unvoiced vowels in IPA?

**Phonotactics**

Stops cannot be found in any consonant clusters, including between words. Only between phrases, when airflow is paused, can a plosive between immediately followed or preceded by a consonant.

Otherwise, there are no phonotactic restrictions.

It is very common for vowels and non-stop consonants to be lengthened, but this is non-phonemic.

Stops are always aspirated.

\[Question\] I'm using this conlang as an opportunity to mess with norms of naturalistic conlanging, but I do want it to seem like a naturalistic conlang in the sense that it arose naturally from Shade communication. Aside from the utter lack of nasals, is there anything that stands out as being particularly unnaturalistic here?

\[Question\] How do I spell unvoiced vowels in IPA?

**Phonotactics**

Stops cannot be found in any consonant clusters, including between words. Only between phrases, when airflow is paused, can a plosive between immediately followed or preceded by a consonant.

Otherwise, there are no phonotactic restrictions.

It is very common for vowels and non-stop consonants to be lengthened, but this is non-phonemic.

1394,0,"I have an idea for a novel with a magic system based on the five senses. One group of magic users, ""The Watchers"": who's magic is based on the sense of sight-- can control, perceive, and project light in the entire electromagnetic spectrum. I had the idea that they might develop a form of language that can only be interpreted by other sight magicians. My thought is that they can communicate through pulses of light that they emit from their eyes (or via some other device).

My initial thought is that this be simply a magical version of fiber optic cables, encoding their spoken language into light pulses, like morse code or binary code. But this felt too sci-fi and not interesting enough.

I thought perhaps that these magicians could use the frequency (hue), length, intensity, and rhythm in order to form ""words"". Almost like being able to speak a logography.

Hue would contain the base meaning of an idea i.e. blue = water.

Length of the pulse could modify the base word, i.e. short blue = drop, long blue = ocean

Intensity could be used as a kind of tonal marker, like in Chinese. i.e. short blue (increasing intensity) = rain drop.

Rhythm could indicate numbers or relative size i.e. short blue (increasing intensity) x 2 = rainfall

I also had another idea about how color theory could also inform word creation. So if blue = water, it's complementary color, orange,  might mean fire. And by extension, an analagous color like turqoise, might mean air.

I also had an idea that tenses might be indicated with the changing of hue, mid pulse. So if the hue redshifts, it indicates the future, and if it blueshifts, it indicates the past, (a reference to the doppler effect).

Well, those are just some initial musings, I'd love to know what y'all think, and if there are other conlangs similar to this that I could gather inspiration from!",Creating non-verbal light-based conlang?,"I have an idea for a novel with a magic system based on the five senses.

1396,0,"So, I've had this idea of doing a musical conlang, in part because I compose my own music. However, it brought me to many questions. Here is my attempt at answering them, feel free to give me any feedback on this conlang. So, first off, how many pitches? Well, for the first note, there would be 12 pitches. Second note, I think will have 2 pitches. Other notes will have 7 or 9 pitches(7 for major, 9 for minor).

Okay, so what would the first note do? Well, I think it would be acting as a sort of topic marker, with each note corresponding to a different topic, maybe like this:  


|Note|Topic|
|:-|:-|
|C|Everyday/Small Talk|
|Db|Love/Dating/Intimate Talk|
|D|Politics/General Announcement (things like: Who are you voting for? The president will give his speech now. Beethoven Concert at 6:00 PM etc.) |
|Eb|Religion|
|E|Exciting/Disappointing Announcement(things like: I'm having a baby! We won the game! I lost. etc.) |
|F|Family talk(things like: So, where do you want to go today children? I'm sorry to say this, but Grandpa passed away. etc.) |
|F#|Not sure yet, maybe some input on this?|
|G|Lecture/Class/Education|
|Ab|Not sure yet, maybe some input on this?|
|A|Children's talk(Children have a higher natural pitch, and I think of A as being a high note. Children also have a lower vocabulary, so it makes sense that they would stick to one or 2 tonics for at least their first  10 years) |
|Bb|Music (things like: Who is your favorite composer/songwriter? What's your favorite genre? I just love Mozart. I can play the piano. etc.) |
|B|Self-talk|

Essentially, the tonic is the topic and would be indicated by something like this at the beginning of the first sentence:  


[Tonic note marking the topic](https://preview.redd.it/9pj02x16ael81.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=957ef23236f6d2f71b1d56be1939475cfff246cd)

A change in topic would be signaled by another one of these long notes at a different pitch, on the downbeat.

The second note indicates the general mood, whether it's a positive or negative mood. It corresponds to the third, the modal note of any key. So a positive mood would be indicated like so:  


[Major key indicating positive mood](https://preview.redd.it/lrv4g7oeael81.png?width=472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=268364a10fba233df3d8fc7aa23f56fb7454d8bc)

This could be happiness, excitement, even a neutral feeling about the situation

A negative mood would be indicated like so:

[Minor key indicating negative mood](https://preview.redd.it/65mnlp5lael81.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f2d4bfc529b4564af4b888cb4fb5b1a3f9286ab)

This could be sadness, anger, frustration, fear, any sort of bad feeling

So major key = positive mood and minor key = negative mood. Here are some common tonic, modal note pairs and what they indicate:  


[Common note pairs and their meaning](https://preview.redd.it/cxid17pvael81.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f41e6e8a0b5145173d5e7f242205ceea37833bb)

A change in mood is indicated by a note from the parallel key suddenly showing up. So, in your everyday situation, this might be Eb, Ab, or Bb for a negative shift and E for a positive shift. A and B wouldn't necessarily indicate a change in mood from negative to positive, as they can be found in variants of the C minor scale.

I don't know what the meter of the music, like whether it's in 3/4 or 6/8 or 4/4 would indicate, but it probably would indicate something, maybe some input on what the meter could indicate would be helpful.

Dynamics have the most relevance and meaning with negative moods. However, they also have  some relevance and meaning with positive moods. A forte dynamic in major would indicate that the person is very happy or even excited. A piano dynamic in major would indicate a more neutral feeling about the situation. Self-talk, which is in the tonic of B, tends to be in the  pianissimo to mezzo-piano range, except when the mood is negative, in which case forte is common as well.

A forte dynamic in minor would indicate a more outward negative mood like anger or fear. A piano  dynamic in minor would indicate a more reserved negative mood like sadness.

I haven't figured out yet how to go from words to music, but I'm thinking that this might be the general relation:

&amp;#x200B;

|Type of sound|Note Value|
|:-|:-|
|Vowels|Long notes, shortest at quarter notes, longest at whole notes |
|Stop Consonants|Short notes, usually eighths or quarters, although they might become sixteenths in fast speech |
|Liquids and Glides|Longer notes at the start of a word, maybe half note or dotted quarter, since they tend to cross syllable boundaries in the middle of words,  probably ties in that case |
|Fricatives|Also longer notes, however, since they have less of a tendency to cross syllable boundaries, there probably wouldn't be any ties where  fricatives are |

Likewise, I haven't figured out when the pitch should rise and fall yet, perhaps you could give me some input on this?

**Any input on it? Do you think this is a good start for my musical conlang?  Anything I'm missing that would be relevant for a musical conlang?**",My Musical Conlang Idea,"So, I've had this idea of doing a musical conlang, in part because I compose my own music. However, it brought me to many questions. Here is my attempt at answering them, feel free to give me any feedback on this conlang. So, first off, how many pitches? Well, for the first note, there would be 12 pitches. Second note, I think will have 2 pitches. Other notes will have 7 or 9 pitches(7 for major, 9 for minor).

Okay, so what would the first note do? Well, I think it would be acting as a sort of topic marker, with each note corresponding to a different topic, maybe like this:  


|Note|Topic|
|:-|:-|
|C|Everyday/Small Talk|
|Db|Love/Dating/Intimate Talk|
|D|Politics/General Announcement (things like: Who are you voting for? The president will give his speech now. Beethoven Concert at 6:00 PM etc.) |
|Eb|Religion|
|E|Exciting/Disappointing Announcement(things like: I'm having a baby! We won the game! I lost. etc.) |
|F|Family talk(things like: So, where do you want to go today children? I'm sorry to say this, but Grandpa passed away. etc.) |
|F#|Not sure yet, maybe some input on this?|
|G|Lecture/Class/Education|
|Ab|Not sure yet, maybe some input on this?|
|A|Children's talk(Children have a higher natural pitch, and I think of A as being a high note. Children also have a lower vocabulary, so it makes sense that they would stick to one or 2 tonics for at least their first  10 years) |
|Bb|Music (things like: Who is your favorite composer/songwriter? What's your favorite genre? I just love Mozart. I can play the piano. etc.) |
|B|Self-talk|

Essentially, the tonic is the topic and would be indicated by something like this at the beginning of the first sentence:  


[Tonic note marking the topic](https://preview.redd.it/9pj02x16ael81.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=957ef23236f6d2f71b1d56be1939475cfff246cd)

A change in topic would be signaled by another one of these long notes at a different pitch, on the downbeat.

The second note indicates the general mood, whether it's a positive or negative mood. It corresponds to the third, the modal note of any key. So a positive mood would be indicated like so:  


[Major key indicating positive mood](https://preview.redd.it/lrv4g7oeael81.png?width=472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=268364a10fba233df3d8fc7aa23f56fb7454d8bc)

This could be happiness, excitement, even a neutral feeling about the situation

A negative mood would be indicated like so:

[Minor key indicating negative mood](https://preview.redd.it/65mnlp5lael81.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f2d4bfc529b4564af4b888cb4fb5b1a3f9286ab)

This could be sadness, anger, frustration, fear, any sort of bad feeling

So major key = positive mood and minor key = negative mood. Here are some common tonic, modal note pairs and what they indicate:  


[Common note pairs and their meaning](https://preview.redd.it/cxid17pvael81.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f41e6e8a0b5145173d5e7f242205ceea37833bb)

A change in mood is indicated by a note from the parallel key suddenly showing up. So, in your everyday situation, this might be Eb, Ab, or Bb for a negative shift and E for a positive shift. A and B wouldn't necessarily indicate a change in mood from negative to positive, as they can be found in variants of the C minor scale.

I don't know what the meter of the music, like whether it's in 3/4 or 6/8 or 4/4 would indicate, but it probably would indicate something, maybe some input on what the meter could indicate would be helpful.

Dynamics have the most relevance and meaning with negative moods. However, they also have  some relevance and meaning with positive moods. A forte dynamic in major would indicate that the person is very happy or even excited. A piano dynamic in major would indicate a more neutral feeling about the situation. Self-talk, which is in the tonic of B, tends to be in the  pianissimo to mezzo-piano range, except when the mood is negative, in which case forte is common as well.

A forte dynamic in minor would indicate a more outward negative mood like anger or fear. A piano  dynamic in minor would indicate a more reserved negative mood like sadness.

1416,0,"# Hello there, I will present you a constructed language which is called Crescentish (Cresenti/كرسانتى) (Hilaali/هلالي) 

[Crescentish language flag](https://preview.redd.it/tvsen8pcv5l81.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d78ec20495f662fce72dff45ea0f0ea05674978f)

 **Why it is called Crescentish?**

 It is called Crescentish since it is delivered from the word Crescent and with a suffix of ish.  

 **Alphabet :**

 Crescentish uses Latin alphabet, no accents for it  It is spelled like Turkish with the addition of x which is the Arabian kh (خ), the Arabian qaf (ق) which is Q, thus, H is spelled depending on the word (Sometimes like ح, sometimes like normal h ه)

  it also uses Perso-Arabic alphabet.   

**Vocabulary :** 

It's vocabulary is mostly delivered from modified Arabic, Persian and Turkish including some Urdu Example : men mixorim yak qaat az ua chok piaara من ميخوارم يک قط از هو پیار Meaning : I want a cute cat Mem, mixorim, yak, az, are all Persian words  Chok, is Turkish word  Qaat, oua, are Arabic words, expect ua has an other different meaning Piaara, which is Urdu word  Pronouns : Men =&gt; I  (Azerbaijani/Persian origin)

  Sen =&gt; You (Turkish origin) 

 Hu/Hi =&gt; He/She (Arabic origin)  

Biz =&gt; we (Turkish origin)

  Siz =&gt; you p (Turkish origin)

  Hular/Hilar (Arabic origin with lar suffix to indicate Plurality)   

Possessive pronouns :  There are two ways of indicating possessive pronouns :

 Men ism/Men ismy/Ismy (all means :my name)  

The first way by adding possessive pronoun 

which is : menim, senin, huum, hium, bizim, sizin, hularum, hilarum 

Example : Menim qaahwe ve senin kaik ladheedh 

It means my coffee and your cake is delicious  

Or  By adding suffix directly like : Ismy, ismat, ismu, ismiz, ismtom, ismhum Like : Ismy Maansur ve ismat Yaasin (means my name is Mansur and your name is yessine)  

The last way is by using both ways together : 

Menim Ismy Maansur, this method is supposed to be formal 

 **Tense :**  

There is four tenses

  Present - Haadher (حاضر)  Past - Maadhi (ماضى)  Simple future - mustaqbaal baasit (مستقبل بسيط)  Composed future - mustaqbaal murakaab (مستقبل مركب)  Present is used for general reality, Science facts and actions that are happening right now  Past is for already happened events  Simple future is for close future  Compared future is for far future 

**Present**

 Present works by adding a suffix of the verb base for example :

 Men Mixorim (I want) 

Sen Mixorin (you want)  

Hu mixor (he wants) 

 Biz mixorimiz (we want) 

 Siz mixoriniz (you want p) 

 Hamlar mixorlar (they want) 

  **Past** 

:Addition of ""it"" to the present  

Example : Men mixorimit  

**Future :**

 Men samixorim (addition of sa to present as a prefix) 

 **Complex future**  

 Addition of saufa (not linked to the word)  Example : Men saufa mixorim 

 **Phrase structure :**

 It is similar to Arabic ( Pronoun verb noun)

  Men konushum Cresenti ve Turky 

  Complex phrase :

 Men istiyorum akmaak az small ve yeni 

(I want bread that is small and new)

 Az means that/which/who  

**Questions**

 We use Kyun (Why)  Ne or Jeh (What)  Keh (Who)  Aay (which)

  Example of questions : Kyun men yaishim bu?  Ismat jeh?  Keh ua yerit menim shekerler?  Ay bunlar zabaanlar ua sert? 

 **Numbers :**

 Numbers in Crescentish are almost same with Turkish  Sefr, Bir, eke, uch, durt, besh, atli, yedi, sekiz, dokus, on...",Zabaan Cresenti,"# Hello there, I will present you a constructed language which is called Crescentish (Cresenti/كرسانتى) (Hilaali/هلالي)

FGLE could use a script *descended* from the Latin alphabet, called the Laker alphabet, which would drop and mod some letters and loan new letters from foreign scripts.

1422,0,"Personally, I used to see it as silly the number of creole-inspired conlangs that seemed to have come to prominance in the 2000s. I'm talking about things like Uropi, Glosa, Lingua Franca Nova, perhaps Neo. Sorry if I missed a few.

Personally, all these conlangs looked very similar to each other to me. It made me wonder why on earth people kept making them, why not just stick to one? Honestly, I thought they looked so similar that honestly they would probably be mutually intelligible.

I wonder though, has anyone actually tested this? Would a conlang like Lingua Franca Nova be mutually intelligible with Glosa? What about Interlingua? 

Of course, I realize this may be hard to test given that for many of these its not hard to figure out most of the vocab even if you don't know the language (assuming you're a westerner anyway). Such a test would have to be conducted with speakers that have no exposure to any other western language. With the ubiquitous of things like English and French, such a person may be hard to find. 

Obviously, this would have to be determined in some way that wouldn't require just having two people see if they could hold a conversation while speaking two different conlangs. I'm not sure how this could be done though, other than possibly comparing texts. I know that wikipedia articles seem to like to compare translations from different auxlangs side by side.

I'm talking about things like Uropi, Glosa, Lingua Franca Nova, perhaps Neo. Sorry if I missed a few.

Personally, all these conlangs looked very similar to each other to me. It made me wonder why on earth people kept making them, why not just stick to one? Honestly, I thought they looked so similar that honestly they would probably be mutually intelligible.

I wonder though, has anyone actually tested this? Would a conlang like Lingua Franca Nova be mutually intelligible with Glosa? What about Interlingua? 

Of course, I realize this may be hard to test given that for many of these its not hard to figure out most of the vocab even if you don't know the language (assuming you're a westerner anyway). Such a test would have to be conducted with speakers that have no exposure to any other western language. With the ubiquitous of things like English and French, such a person may be hard to find. 

Obviously, this would have to be determined in some way that wouldn't require just having two people see if they could hold a conversation while speaking two different conlangs. I'm not sure how this could be done though, other than possibly comparing texts. I know that wikipedia articles seem to like to compare translations from different auxlangs side by side.

1431,0,"The language is to appear in a computer game and is meant to fit the following criteria:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) It should be easy for English-speaking people to learn as much of it as they have to for game purposes.

However, they won't have to learn all that much, because the player will eventually find a Gikimrp-to-English translation device.

&amp;#x200B;

(2) Therefore it should also be easy enough for me to write the code for a Gikimrp-to-English translator. As this will be an in-game artifact, it can be as flawed as I like, 'cos those will be **in-game flaws**, and narratively justified, but it'll have to be good enough (a) to translate all the in-game text well enough for gameplay (b) so that anything the player composes in Gikimrp to fool around with the thing will translate, if not flawlessly, then in a sort of Google-Translate, an-attempt-was-made sort of style.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) But the language shouldn't be anything like a relex of English, because this offends my soul and would be profoundly unrealistic. It's actually meant to be a language for aliens, albeit aliens who are very like us and have humanish things like advertising and wedding ceremonies and poetry and drivers' licenses. Nonetheless, it shouldn't put one in mind of English or indeed Indo-European. I've drawn a lot of inspiration from Sumerian, although Gikimrp is not really an agglutinative language. (Perhaps one of you wise people can tell me what the right name is?)

&amp;#x200B;

(4) It should have a ""feel"". With a natlang or a good conlang, you know in two or three words which language you're reading. (Though with Gikimrp the longer words do come with a faint air of Jonathan Swift if you know what I mean.)

&amp;#x200B;

(5) While is should be easy on the surface, there should be non-obvious rules which one doesn't *need* to know but which a player can discover if they are also interested in linguistics. It should have depth in that way, it shouldn't be a cardboard cutout of a language.

&amp;#x200B;

(6) I should be able to put it together quite quickly, because this will only be one part of a bigger project.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a short draft for criticism. I haven't supplied much vocabulary, and what I have is just for example and may well be replaced: I want to randomly generate most of it the actual vocabulary from my phonology, and it may well turn out for technical reasons to be easier to generate all of it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Sounds:

&amp;#x200B;

Sounds can be placed into four categories:

&amp;#x200B;

The six basic stops, voiced and unvoiced: b, p, d, t, g, k.

&amp;#x200B;

Nasals and fricatives, all voiced: m, n, v and z.

&amp;#x200B;

Liquids: r and l

&amp;#x200B;

Vowels: a, e, i, o, u, y, always short.

&amp;#x200B;

Vowels are as in English except i is like short French i; u is the u in ""but""; y is the u in ""bull"".

&amp;#x200B;

Vowels are always short and always given their full quality: there is no schwa.

&amp;#x200B;

When syllables are stuck together, they undergo no sound changes as a result of this, except that a stop between two vowels becomes aspirated. This is not recorded in written Gikimrp, and indeed most native speakers are unaware of it unless they are linguists, just as English speakers are largely unaware of aspirating the p in ""pin"". This lack of (at least written) changes helps with points (1) and (5) above: having a nice transparent system of word-formation will help players understand the language as necessary, but it will also offer them lots of curious unnecessary things about to learn about it if they like linguistics.

&amp;#x200B;

# Roots:

&amp;#x200B;

All roots of content words are based on the CVC pattern. (Prepositions and a few other oddments like the negative *zo* are CV or V: for example *ly*, ""to""; *ro*: ""for""; *i*, ""like""; *e*, ""of"", etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

C1 can be any consonant.

&amp;#x200B;

V can be any vowel, or either liquid so long as C1 wasn't a liquid.

&amp;#x200B;

C2 can only be a stop.

&amp;#x200B;

This only allows for 552 roots (if I have my math right) not all of which are realized in the language.

&amp;#x200B;

# Nouns:

&amp;#x200B;

Pluralization is achieved by C1VC2 → C1VC2VC2: *gip*, ""house""; *gipip*, ""houses"".

&amp;#x200B;

Compound nouns are formed out of entire phrases: mousetrap is just *bidronyp*: ""trap-for-mouse"". Entire short sentences, indeed, can be converted to nouns, e.g:

&amp;#x200B;

*kugbutigok* = traveler (""S/he-goes-far"".)

*kugpatgip* = builder (""S/he-builds-house"".)

&amp;#x200B;

The use of the third-person pronoun in this way to produce occupational nouns is very common. VP constructions are also common: *bopved*, ""do-it"", job; *lublubved*, ""devour-it"", favorite food; *mytkug*, ""love-him/her"", crush,  *giknid*, ""trip-me"", personal weakness, blind spot.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this promiscuity in forming nouns shouldn't mislead English speakers. The phrases must follow Gikimrp rules, not English ones. For example, simply gluing together nouns, as in English,  never makes a compound noun: \**gapvrt*, ""walking-stick"", is meaningless in Gikimrp: one must say *vrtrogap*, ""stick for walk(ing)"".  Similarly a V + preposition construction, so reasonable in English (""hook-up"", ""go-to"", ""put-down"") is impossible in Gikimrp, since a preposition must be followed by a noun/pronoun.

&amp;#x200B;

It is always the first noun/pronoun of a compound which is pluralized: travelers is *kugugbutlygok*, not \**kugbutlygokok* (c.f. ""barristers-at-law"", etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

The other nouns in a compound are **not** pluralized except to make a point: i.e. a professional builder is a *kugpatgip*, a ""s/he-builds-house"", not a \**kugpatgipip*, a ""s/he-builds-houses"". (But a multiple home-owner would necessarily be a *kugzrdgipip*, a ""s/he-has-houses"".)

&amp;#x200B;

Stress in compound words falls on the first syllable and then secondarily on alternating syllables unless the syllable is open (i.e. derived from a preposition) in which case it is delayed until the next: *KUGbutiGOK*; *KUGugBUTiGOK*.

&amp;#x200B;

# Pronouns

&amp;#x200B;

These are just like nouns, uninflected and pluralizing regularly:

&amp;#x200B;

*nid*, ""I""; *nidid*, ""we"";

*mup*, ""you""; *mupup*, ""y'all""

*kug*, ""s/he""; *kugug*, ""they""

*ved*, ""it"";	*veded*, ""they, those things"".

&amp;#x200B;

# Adjectives

&amp;#x200B;

Nouns are turned into adjectives by the preposition *i*, ""like"". This follows the qualified noun, of course. This is the only way to form adjectives or adverbs, meaning that the language is full of stock metaphors, e.g.: *i pag*, ""like water"" = weak; *i zrn*, ""like a cloud"", quiet, quietly. As with compound nouns, pluralization is used only to make a point, even when the subject is plural: e.g. one would write *kugug kep i zrn*, literally ""They are like a cloud"" to mean ""They are quiet"", rather than \**kugug kep i zrnrn*, ""They are like clouds"". But to say for example ""They are numerous"", a plural must be used: *kugug kep i nudud*, ""They are like stars"".

&amp;#x200B;

# Verbs

&amp;#x200B;

These are uninflected even for number. New verbs can be produced from old verbs in three ways:

&amp;#x200B;

* By intensifying reduplication: *lub*, ""eat"", *lublub*, pig out, devour.
* By suffixing a pronoun to produce a reflexive: *vyk*, ""wash""; *nid vyknid*, ""I bathe"".
* By suffixing an adverbial phrase, *i* \+ noun: *but*, ""go""; *butinyp*, ""go-like-a-mouse"", creep, be stealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

# Clauses

&amp;#x200B;

Main clauses have a fixed structure of which only parts (4) and (5) below are compulsory, but all of which, if they do occur, must occur in the right order.

&amp;#x200B;

(1) A word indicating time: *zep*, *nat*, *vut*, *nuk* or *pag*.

&amp;#x200B;

* *zep* indicates the future. *zep* is **not** used when there is a time actually specified in the clause: \**zep ki vudtavud nid bop ved* would never be used for ""I will do it tomorrow"", since *ki vudtavud*, ""tomorrow"", makes the preceding *zep* superfluous.
* *nat* is a more emphatic future: ""I sure will""; ""you make certain you do now""; ""so let it be"". This, unlike *zep*, can be used with a specified time: *nat ki vudtavud nid bop ved*: ""I will for definite do it tomorrow"".
* *vut* indicates something that happened regularly or in an ongoing way in the past but does so no longer. *vut i zrn nid kep*: ""Formerly like a cloud \[i.e. silent\] I was"" : I used to keep quiet but now I am speaking out.
* *nuk* indicates something still happening regularly or in an ongoing way: *nuk ti kugugbepvirok nid bep*, I sing (regularly, as a hobby or profession) in a choir; *nuk kugug vop brp*: they are digging up the road (and have been for the past fortnight, and will continue to do so for the forseeabe future).
* *pag* is perfective, it refers to a past event that has relevant effects in the present: *nid bupnid*: ""I injured \[or am injuring\] myself""; *pag nid bupnid*: ""I injured myself and I still hurt; I have injured myself; I a in current need of medial attention"". Other forms of the past are indicated just by adverbial phrases meaning ""yesterday"", ""last year"", etc, or not indicated at all, but the present distinguished from the past by context.

&amp;#x200B;

(2) A negative particle *zo*, e.g. *zep zo nid bep*, I will not sing.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) Adverbial phrases expressible as preposition + noun, e.g. *luk ti kugugbepvirok nid bep*, I (regularly) sing in a choir, where ""*ti kugugbepvirok*"" is ""in a choir""; i.e. the word order is ""regularly in a choir I sing"".

&amp;#x200B;

There are rules for the order in which such phrases can occur within slot (3) similar to German time-manner-place, or the English rules for adjectives exemplified by ""lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife"": a set order in which the prepositions can occur. (There must have been some general discussion of such rules on this subreddit, if some old-timer would be lovely enough to either give me a link or tell me what to search for? Thank you.)

&amp;#x200B;

(4) The subject (+ qualifying phrases of the form preposition + noun, e.g. ""of the child"", ""on the rug"", ""like a cloud"" etc, again with an order determined by the ranking of prepositions).

&amp;#x200B;

(5) The verb.

&amp;#x200B;

(6) The object (+ qualifying phrases as in (4)).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested in criticisms, of course, but also in ideas to make it more interesting which don't make much work for me or **any** for the player.

I would like to intensify the second aspect without at all lessening the first.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this promiscuity in forming nouns shouldn't mislead English speakers. The phrases must follow Gikimrp rules, not English ones. For example, simply gluing together nouns, as in English,  never makes a compound noun: \**gapvrt*, ""walking-stick"", is meaningless in Gikimrp: one must say *vrtrogap*, ""stick for walk(ing)"".  Similarly a V + preposition construction, so reasonable in English (""hook-up"", ""go-to"", ""put-down"") is impossible in Gikimrp, since a preposition must be followed by a noun/pronoun.

&amp;#x200B;

It is always the first noun/pronoun of a compound which is pluralized: travelers is *kugugbutlygok*, not \**kugbutlygokok* (c.f. ""barristers-at-law"", etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

The other nouns in a compound are **not** pluralized except to make a point: i.e. a professional builder is a *kugpatgip*, a ""s/he-builds-house"", not a \**kugpatgipip*, a ""s/he-builds-houses"". (But a multiple home-owner would necessarily be a *kugzrdgipip*, a ""s/he-has-houses"".)

&amp;#x200B;

Stress in compound words falls on the first syllable and then secondarily on alternating syllables unless the syllable is open (i.e. derived from a preposition) in which case it is delayed until the next: *KUGbutiGOK*; *KUGugBUTiGOK*.

&amp;#x200B;

# Pronouns

&amp;#x200B;

These are just like nouns, uninflected and pluralizing regularly:

&amp;#x200B;

*nid*, ""I""; *nidid*, ""we"";

*mup*, ""you""; *mupup*, ""y'all""

*kug*, ""s/he""; *kugug*, ""they""

*ved*, ""it"";	*veded*, ""they, those things"".

&amp;#x200B;

# Adjectives

&amp;#x200B;

Nouns are turned into adjectives by the preposition *i*, ""like"". This follows the qualified noun, of course. This is the only way to form adjectives or adverbs, meaning that the language is full of stock metaphors, e.g.: *i pag*, ""like water"" = weak; *i zrn*, ""like a cloud"", quiet, quietly. As with compound nouns, pluralization is used only to make a point, even when the subject is plural: e.g. one would write *kugug kep i zrn*, literally ""They are like a cloud"" to mean ""They are quiet"", rather than \**kugug kep i zrnrn*, ""They are like clouds"". But to say for example ""They are numerous"", a plural must be used: *kugug kep i nudud*, ""They are like stars"".

&amp;#x200B;

# Verbs

&amp;#x200B;

These are uninflected even for number. New verbs can be produced from old verbs in three ways:

&amp;#x200B;

* By intensifying reduplication: *lub*, ""eat"", *lublub*, pig out, devour.
* By suffixing a pronoun to produce a reflexive: *vyk*, ""wash""; *nid vyknid*, ""I bathe"".
* By suffixing an adverbial phrase, *i* \+ noun: *but*, ""go""; *butinyp*, ""go-like-a-mouse"", creep, be stealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

# Clauses

&amp;#x200B;

Main clauses have a fixed structure of which only parts (4) and (5) below are compulsory, but all of which, if they do occur, must occur in the right order.

&amp;#x200B;

(1) A word indicating time: *zep*, *nat*, *vut*, *nuk* or *pag*.

&amp;#x200B;

* *zep* indicates the future. *zep* is **not** used when there is a time actually specified in the clause: \**zep ki vudtavud nid bop ved* would never be used for ""I will do it tomorrow"", since *ki vudtavud*, ""tomorrow"", makes the preceding *zep* superfluous.
* *nat* is a more emphatic future: ""I sure will""; ""you make certain you do now""; ""so let it be"". This, unlike *zep*, can be used with a specified time: *nat ki vudtavud nid bop ved*: ""I will for definite do it tomorrow"".
* *vut* indicates something that happened regularly or in an ongoing way in the past but does so no longer. *vut i zrn nid kep*: ""Formerly like a cloud \[i.e. silent\] I was"" : I used to keep quiet but now I am speaking out.
* *nuk* indicates something still happening regularly or in an ongoing way: *nuk ti kugugbepvirok nid bep*, I sing (regularly, as a hobby or profession) in a choir; *nuk kugug vop brp*: they are digging up the road (and have been for the past fortnight, and will continue to do so for the forseeabe future).
* *pag* is perfective, it refers to a past event that has relevant effects in the present: *nid bupnid*: ""I injured \[or am injuring\] myself""; *pag nid bupnid*: ""I injured myself and I still hurt; I have injured myself; I a in current need of medial attention"". Other forms of the past are indicated just by adverbial phrases meaning ""yesterday"", ""last year"", etc, or not indicated at all, but the present distinguished from the past by context.

&amp;#x200B;

(2) A negative particle *zo*, e.g. *zep zo nid bep*, I will not sing.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) Adverbial phrases expressible as preposition + noun, e.g. *luk ti kugugbepvirok nid bep*, I (regularly) sing in a choir, where ""*ti kugugbepvirok*"" is ""in a choir""; i.e. the word order is ""regularly in a choir I sing"".

&amp;#x200B;

There are rules for the order in which such phrases can occur within slot (3) similar to German time-manner-place, or the English rules for adjectives exemplified by ""lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife"": a set order in which the prepositions can occur. (There must have been some general discussion of such rules on this subreddit, if some old-timer would be lovely enough to either give me a link or tell me what to search for? Thank you.)

&amp;#x200B;

(4) The subject (+ qualifying phrases of the form preposition + noun, e.g. ""of the child"", ""on the rug"", ""like a cloud"" etc, again with an order determined by the ranking of prepositions).

&amp;#x200B;

(5) The verb.

&amp;#x200B;

(6) The object (+ qualifying phrases as in (4)).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That's what I've got so far. Thanks for your comments. I'm interested in criticisms, of course, but also in ideas to make it more interesting which don't make much work for me or **any** for the player. The language as it stands allows me to communicate certain ideas in a way that is very simple and SVO and uninflected, while still having a depth of more thought for people who want to poke around in it. I would like to intensify the second aspect without at all lessening the first.

1434,0,"This is about the root **tza'** '*run*' in my conlang Patches---its lexical semantics and some of its derivational possibilities, especially those derivations affecting valency or lexical aspect.

[There's also a PDF](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/649090609293950976/948384422649032744/akam-run.pdf).

# tza'

Without overt derivation, **tza'** can only be used as an intransitive verb, its one argument the person or thing that's described as running:

    (1) tza'  qichʼím
        run   Qichim 
        ""Qichim was running""

(I'll translate all sample sentences in the past tense. Patches does have a past tense marker, but it's rarely obligatory.)

**tza'** is a durative verb. You'd often translate **tza'** into English using the progressive (as I just did). You can also use **tza'** with the Patches version of a progressive, using the present tense particle **ha'**:

    (2) ha'   tza'  qichʼím
        PRES  run   Qichim 
        ""Qichim was (still) running""

(**ha'** is a relative present tense, whereas English tenses are absolute; when the topic time is past, the Patches present normally corresponds to the English past.)

You can also make the duration explicit:

    (3) tza'  qichʼím  wajék    
        run   Qichim   one_stick
        ""Qichim ran for one stick""

Also the distance:

    (4) tza'  qichʼim  waqwár  
        run   Qichim   one_drum
        ""Qichim ran one drum""

(A stick is about 80 minutes; the expression derives from the use of incense to measure time. A drum is about 3\~km, and is supposed to represent the distance at which drumming can reliably be heard.)

Non-durative verbs (such as **kás** '*arrive*' and **chá** '*open*') cannot occur with an overt statement of duration or with **ha'**, and normally get translated by English perfectives.

**tza'** is also nontelic. In Patches, that means it cannot occur with a resultative complement:

    (5) *tza'  qichʼím  wothus
         run   Qichim   tired 
         Intended: ""Qichim ran and became tired""

It follows that a complement headed by the dative proposition **os** can only be interpreted as giving a direction, not a destination:

    (6) tza'  qichʼím  on      kʼupech
        run   Qichim   to_the  market 
        ""Qichim ran towards the market""
        Not: ""Qichim ran to the market""

This extends to the interpretation of Patches's associated motion prefixes. For example, cislocative **extza'** can only mean '*run here (in this location)*' or '*run towards here*,' not '*run to here*.'

The lack of resultatives might well correspond to the fact that the sole argument of **tza'** gets interpreted as an agent, not a patient, given that in Patches (as maybe in all languages that have them) resultative complements must associate with a patient.

Finally, underived **tza'** can have a habitual meaning:

    (7) tza'  qichʼim  aydo   an      kʼupech
        run   Qichim   often  in_the  market 
        ""Qichim often runs in the market""

(This is also possible with non-durative verbs. In fact part of the reason I'm saying that **tza'** is inherently durative rather than imperfective is that the distinction in question is unrelated to habituality.)

# tza''a (the punctive)

Durative **tza'** can derive a punctive verb by addition of a glottal stop. With **tza'**, the glottal stop is suffixed, creating a geminate, which in turn triggers an epenthetic copy vowel. With other verbs, the punctive affix **-'** normally gets infixed.

(In Patches, plain glottal stops cannot occur before a vowel, and surface largely as glottalisation on adjacent segments. By contrast, a geminate glottal stop always occurs between vowels and involves full glottal closure; and that makes the contrast pretty easy to detect.)

**tza''a** most often has an inceptive meaning:

    (8) tza''a     qichʼím  ay  yow  eskápe      exkás  =shaw  eywá'    
        run:PUNCT  Qichim   on  DET  soldier:PL  arrive =3p.A  3p.B:NMLZ
        ""Qichim ran when the soldiers arrived""

(I promise that it's a coincidence that Patches **eskápe** '*soldiers*' looks like English ""escape."")

Note that the English here doesn't make it obvious that the verb is getting a specifically inceptive interpretation in this example. Still, if the story continued, ""Then the soldiers shouted at her to stop,"" there'd be no implication that Qichim had stopped running before the soldiers shouted; quite the contrary. Thus, the event that's put in sequence with other events here is not Qichim running, but Qichim starting to run.

Note also this contrasting example:

    (9) tza'       qichʼím  ay  yo   eskápe      exkás  =shaw  eywá'    
        run:PUNCT  Qichim   on  DET  soldier:PL  arrive =3p.A  3p.B:NMLZ
        ""Qichim was running when the soldiers arrived""

When **tza'** is used underived, its sense is durative, and the temporal adjunct must get a simultaneous rather than a sequential interpretation.

Punctive **tza''a** can also have a completive or telic sense when it occurs with what I'll call a bounding object:

    (10) tza''a     qichʼím  ne   móòy  os  no   yóròq 
         run:PUNCT  Qichim   DET  path  to  DET  shrine
         ""Qichim ran the path to the shrine""

It's pretty hard to use plain measures of distance or duration in this construction; they pretty much have to be definite:

    (11) tza''a     qichʼim  ne   waqwár  
         run:PUNCT  Qichim   DET  one_drum
         ""Qichim ran the one drum""

This could be a reasonable thing to say if a particular one-drum route had already been established as a discourse topic. (Reminder: one drum is a distance of about 3\~km.)

Bounding objects don't have to be definite, or even specific, in downward-entailing contexts. These examples use nonspecific **cham wáy** '*one step*' as a sort of minimal object:

    (12) 
         
         a. tza''aw        =hikw  cham  wáy
            run:PUNCT:1s.B =NEG   step  one
            ""I didn't run a step""
         
         b. tetzeyew         =tʼan  fáwkàw     hosh  ḥeytza''akwen        cham  wáy
            be_like:INC:1s.B =MOD   collapsed  if    again_run:PUNCT:MOD  step  one
            ""I'll collapse if I have to run another step""

# tzaa' (the cognate object)

**tza'** can derive a cognate object by lengthening its vowel, a common method.

In English, cognate objects are often used in light verb constructions (""have a run""), but in Patches you normally use them with the cognate verb. With **tza'**, this can be the underived, durative verb:

    (13) tza'w     tzaa'  (wáy)
         run:1s.B  run     one 
         ""I was having a run""

(**wáy** '*one*' is common but not necessary in this construction.)

It can also be used with punctive **tza''a**; this is another context that allows a nonspecific bounding object:

    (14) tza''aw         tzaa'  (wáy)
         run:PUNCT:1s.B  run     one 
         ""I went for a run""

As in English, the use of a cognate object implies a certain casualness, and you often find them used along with the clitic **=wala** '*for fun*':

    (15) tza'w    =wala     tzaa'  wáy
         run:1s.b =for_fun  run    one
         ""I was just running for fun""

You can also use cognate objects to comment on an event or activity:

    (16) chùl  tzaa'  ne   xeen
         good  run    DET  3s  
         ""That was a good run""

# tza'm (the middle)

**tza'** can form a sort of middle using **-m** (which is common for activity verbs). The resulting verb is still intransitive, but its one argument is understood to be a patient as well as an agent. Because **tza'** by itself does not encode patient semantics, this requires that a resultative complement be added. English can often use reflexives in about the same way.

Here's what it looks like:

    (17) tza'm    qichʼím  wothus
         run:MID  Qichim   tired 
         Intended: ""Qichim ran herself tired""

(Contrast (5).)

In this form, the verb can take a destination complement:

    (18) tza'm    qichʼim  on      kʼupech
         run:MID  Qichim   to_the  market 
         ""Qichim ran herself to the market""

# tza'ches and tza''aches (the causatives) and tza'ch and tza''ach (the applicatives)

You can form a causatives with **-ches**:

    (19) 
         
         a. tza'chesi     =en    qichʼím  ne   xakwi   on      kʼupech
            run:CAUS:3p.B =3s.A  Qichim   Det  dog:PL  to_the  market 
            ""Qichim was running the dogs to the market""
         
         b. tza''achesi         =en    qichʼím  ne   xakwi   on      kʼupech
            run:PUNCT:CAUS:3p.B =3s.A  Qichim   Det  dog:PL  to_the  market 
            ""Qichim ran the dogs to the market""

As you can see, in this form the verb does allow destination complements (and it also allows other resultative complements).

**-ches** looks like it ought to be decomposable into two suffixes that occur separately with other verbs: applicative **-ch** and causative **-s**. The semantics are about right: **-ch** would add a patient, the person or thing that gets run, and **-s** would add an agent. And in fact you can use the applicative on its own:

    (20) tza'chi        en   xakwi   on      kʼupech
         run:APPL:3p.B  DET  dog:PL  to_the  market 
         ""The dogs were being run to market""

The English translation here uses a passive, but there's no passive in the Patches. Still, I think the Patches does imply the involvement of an agent, if only because using **tza'ch** rather than **tza'** implies that the dogs are not themselves the agents of their own running.

This implies that in Patches, apparently passive meanings are treated as more basic than transitive ones. That's generally true; for example, without overt transitivisation, **kwo'** means '*be eaten*,' not '*eat*.' This is a fairly rare pattern, cross-linguistically; I learned about it reading about Salish languages.

It also implies that I really ought to gloss **-ches** as '*APPL:CAUS*.'

Note that English ""run"" has a variety of non-agentive uses: a machine can run well or poorly, and a stream can run down a hill. So far **tza'** doesn't get used like this, but maybe it will eventually take on some non-agentive uses; if so, it's likely that it will actually be applicativised **tza'ch** that gets used in those new contexts.

(A brief look under the hood. I'm actually thinking of **tza'** as inherently zero-transitive, with no selected arguments. At the same time, I'm supposing that there's a rule that a verb must surface with at least one argument, with the default being that an agent is added if nothing has been. So applicative **-ch** not only adds a patient argument, it also prevents the default agent argument from getting added---which is why you then need the overt transitivising suffix **-s** to get an agent.)

# tza'·tza' (the participle)

**tza'** can form a participle by full reduplication. I write this **tza'·tza'** because for some purposes the prosodic boundary between the reduplicants is worth marking.

This is what I call a circumstantial participle. Circumstantial participles are not oriented towards event participants; in this case that means that **tza'·tza'** does not describe the person who runs.

**tza'·tza'** can be used as a sort of manner adverb:

    (21) ù   qichʼím  tza'·tza'  os  no   yóròq 
         go  Qichim   running    to  DET  shrine
         ""Qichim went running to the shrine""

It can also be used adnominally with a small number of nouns. For example:

    (22) tʼaam  tza'·tza'
         place  running  
         ""place for running, race course""

**hóch tza'·tza'** '*running person*' is possible, but not with the meaning you might expect. It can't describe a person who is running, but if, say, there's a day of competitions, the **hóch tza'·tza'** might be the person in charge of the races.

I'm pretty sure that **tza'·tza'**, and Patches participles in general, cannot be used as predicates. (This makes them quite unusual, since Patches allows most content words to function as predicates.)

# Plurals

Many Patches verbs can form verbal plurals, either by initial **CV-** reduplication or with the suffix **-owi**. But only verbs that select patient arguments have plurals, so this is possible not for **tza'** itself but only for some of the verbs derived from it. We have the following forms:

* **tza'·mowi** '*run:MID:PL*'
* **tza'·chowi** '*run:APPL:PL*'
* **tza'che·sowi** '*run:APPL:CAUS:PL*'
* **tza''a·mowi** '*run:PUNC:MID:PL*'
* **tza''a·chowi** '*run:PUNC:APPL:PL*'
* **tza''ache.sowi** '*run:PUNC:APPL:PL*'

The semantics of these forms is not very surprising (or at least I haven't figured out anything very interesting to say about them). They can only be used with a plural patient, but that's not enough; they also imply that the event described by the verb is itself somehow plural. Here's an example with a middle:

    (23) tza'mowiy        wothus
         run:MID:PL:3p.B  tired 
         Intended: ""They ran themselves tired""

This would be appropriate only as a description of some people who, independently of one another, ran themselves tired; a single group running together and becoming tired together would be described instead as **tza'mi** '*run:MID:3p.B*,' without the verbal plural.

# Coda

I think that's it!","""run""","This is about the root **tza'** '*run*' in my conlang Patches---its lexical semantics and some of its derivational possibilities, especially those derivations affecting valency or lexical aspect.

[There's also a PDF](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/649090609293950976/948384422649032744/akam-run.pdf).

# tza'

Without overt derivation, **tza'** can only be used as an intransitive verb, its one argument the person or thing that's described as running:

    (1) tza'  qichʼím
        run   Qichim 
        ""Qichim was running""

(I'll translate all sample sentences in the past tense. Patches does have a past tense marker, but it's rarely obligatory.)

**tza'** is a durative verb. You'd often translate **tza'** into English using the progressive (as I just did). You can also use **tza'** with the Patches version of a progressive, using the present tense particle **ha'**:

    (2) ha'   tza'  qichʼím
        PRES  run   Qichim 
        ""Qichim was (still) running""

(**ha'** is a relative present tense, whereas English tenses are absolute; when the topic time is past, the Patches present normally corresponds to the English past.)

You can also make the duration explicit:

    (3) tza'  qichʼím  wajék    
        run   Qichim   one_stick
        ""Qichim ran for one stick""

Also the distance:

    (4) tza'  qichʼim  waqwár  
        run   Qichim   one_drum
        ""Qichim ran one drum""

(A stick is about 80 minutes; the expression derives from the use of incense to measure time. A drum is about 3\~km, and is supposed to represent the distance at which drumming can reliably be heard.)

Non-durative verbs (such as **kás** '*arrive*' and **chá** '*open*') cannot occur with an overt statement of duration or with **ha'**, and normally get translated by English perfectives.

**tza'** is also nontelic. In Patches, that means it cannot occur with a resultative complement:

    (5) *tza'  qichʼím  wothus
         run   Qichim   tired 
         Intended: ""Qichim ran and became tired""

It follows that a complement headed by the dative proposition **os** can only be interpreted as giving a direction, not a destination:

    (6) tza'  qichʼím  on      kʼupech
        run   Qichim   to_the  market 
        ""Qichim ran towards the market""
        Not: ""Qichim ran to the market""

This extends to the interpretation of Patches's associated motion prefixes. For example, cislocative **extza'** can only mean '*run here (in this location)*' or '*run towards here*,' not '*run to here*.'

The lack of resultatives might well correspond to the fact that the sole argument of **tza'** gets interpreted as an agent, not a patient, given that in Patches (as maybe in all languages that have them) resultative complements must associate with a patient.

Finally, underived **tza'** can have a habitual meaning:

    (7) tza'  qichʼim  aydo   an      kʼupech
        run   Qichim   often  in_the  market 
        ""Qichim often runs in the market""

(This is also possible with non-durative verbs. In fact part of the reason I'm saying that **tza'** is inherently durative rather than imperfective is that the distinction in question is unrelated to habituality.)

# tza''a (the punctive)

Durative **tza'** can derive a punctive verb by addition of a glottal stop. With **tza'**, the glottal stop is suffixed, creating a geminate, which in turn triggers an epenthetic copy vowel. With other verbs, the punctive affix **-'** normally gets infixed.

(In Patches, plain glottal stops cannot occur before a vowel, and surface largely as glottalisation on adjacent segments. By contrast, a geminate glottal stop always occurs between vowels and involves full glottal closure; and that makes the contrast pretty easy to detect.)

**tza''a** most often has an inceptive meaning:

    (8) tza''a     qichʼím  ay  yow  eskápe      exkás  =shaw  eywá'    
        run:PUNCT  Qichim   on  DET  soldier:PL  arrive =3p.A  3p.B:NMLZ
        ""Qichim ran when the soldiers arrived""

(I promise that it's a coincidence that Patches **eskápe** '*soldiers*' looks like English ""escape."")

Note that the English here doesn't make it obvious that the verb is getting a specifically inceptive interpretation in this example. Still, if the story continued, ""Then the soldiers shouted at her to stop,"" there'd be no implication that Qichim had stopped running before the soldiers shouted; quite the contrary. Thus, the event that's put in sequence with other events here is not Qichim running, but Qichim starting to run.

Note also this contrasting example:

    (9) tza'       qichʼím  ay  yo   eskápe      exkás  =shaw  eywá'    
        run:PUNCT  Qichim   on  DET  soldier:PL  arrive =3p.A  3p.B:NMLZ
        ""Qichim was running when the soldiers arrived""

When **tza'** is used underived, its sense is durative, and the temporal adjunct must get a simultaneous rather than a sequential interpretation.

Punctive **tza''a** can also have a completive or telic sense when it occurs with what I'll call a bounding object:

    (10) tza''a     qichʼím  ne   móòy  os  no   yóròq 
         run:PUNCT  Qichim   DET  path  to  DET  shrine
         ""Qichim ran the path to the shrine""

It's pretty hard to use plain measures of distance or duration in this construction; they pretty much have to be definite:

    (11) tza''a     qichʼim  ne   waqwár  
         run:PUNCT  Qichim   DET  one_drum
         ""Qichim ran the one drum""

This could be a reasonable thing to say if a particular one-drum route had already been established as a discourse topic. (Reminder: one drum is a distance of about 3\~km.)

Bounding objects don't have to be definite, or even specific, in downward-entailing contexts. These examples use nonspecific **cham wáy** '*one step*' as a sort of minimal object:

    (12) 
         
         a. tza''aw        =hikw  cham  wáy
            run:PUNCT:1s.B =NEG   step  one
            ""I didn't run a step""
         
         b. tetzeyew         =tʼan  fáwkàw     hosh  ḥeytza''akwen        cham  wáy
            be_like:INC:1s.B =MOD   collapsed  if    again_run:PUNCT:MOD  step  one
            ""I'll collapse if I have to run another step""

# tzaa' (the cognate object)

**tza'** can derive a cognate object by lengthening its vowel, a common method.

In English, cognate objects are often used in light verb constructions (""have a run""), but in Patches you normally use them with the cognate verb. With **tza'**, this can be the underived, durative verb:

    (13) tza'w     tzaa'  (wáy)
         run:1s.B  run     one 
         ""I was having a run""

(**wáy** '*one*' is common but not necessary in this construction.)

It can also be used with punctive **tza''a**; this is another context that allows a nonspecific bounding object:

    (14) tza''aw         tzaa'  (wáy)
         run:PUNCT:1s.B  run     one 
         ""I went for a run""

As in English, the use of a cognate object implies a certain casualness, and you often find them used along with the clitic **=wala** '*for fun*':

    (15) tza'w    =wala     tzaa'  wáy
         run:1s.b =for_fun  run    one
         ""I was just running for fun""

You can also use cognate objects to comment on an event or activity:

    (16) chùl  tzaa'  ne   xeen
         good  run    DET  3s  
         ""That was a good run""

# tza'm (the middle)

**tza'** can form a sort of middle using **-m** (which is common for activity verbs). The resulting verb is still intransitive, but its one argument is understood to be a patient as well as an agent. Because **tza'** by itself does not encode patient semantics, this requires that a resultative complement be added. English can often use reflexives in about the same way.

Here's what it looks like:

    (17) tza'm    qichʼím  wothus
         run:MID  Qichim   tired 
         Intended: ""Qichim ran herself tired""

(Contrast (5).)

In this form, the verb can take a destination complement:

    (18) tza'm    qichʼim  on      kʼupech
         run:MID  Qichim   to_the  market 
         ""Qichim ran herself to the market""

# tza'ches and tza''aches (the causatives) and tza'ch and tza''ach (the applicatives)

You can form a causatives with **-ches**:

    (19) 
         
         a. tza'chesi     =en    qichʼím  ne   xakwi   on      kʼupech
            run:CAUS:3p.B =3s.A  Qichim   Det  dog:PL  to_the  market 
            ""Qichim was running the dogs to the market""
         
         b. tza''achesi         =en    qichʼím  ne   xakwi   on      kʼupech
            run:PUNCT:CAUS:3p.B =3s.A  Qichim   Det  dog:PL  to_the  market 
            ""Qichim ran the dogs to the market""

As you can see, in this form the verb does allow destination complements (and it also allows other resultative complements).

**-ches** looks like it ought to be decomposable into two suffixes that occur separately with other verbs: applicative **-ch** and causative **-s**. The semantics are about right: **-ch** would add a patient, the person or thing that gets run, and **-s** would add an agent. And in fact you can use the applicative on its own:

    (20) tza'chi        en   xakwi   on      kʼupech
         run:APPL:3p.B  DET  dog:PL  to_the  market 
         ""The dogs were being run to market""

The English translation here uses a passive, but there's no passive in the Patches. Still, I think the Patches does imply the involvement of an agent, if only because using **tza'ch** rather than **tza'** implies that the dogs are not themselves the agents of their own running.

This implies that in Patches, apparently passive meanings are treated as more basic than transitive ones. That's generally true; for example, without overt transitivisation, **kwo'** means '*be eaten*,' not '*eat*.' This is a fairly rare pattern, cross-linguistically; I learned about it reading about Salish languages.

It also implies that I really ought to gloss **-ches** as '*APPL:CAUS*.'

Note that English ""run"" has a variety of non-agentive uses: a machine can run well or poorly, and a stream can run down a hill. So far **tza'** doesn't get used like this, but maybe it will eventually take on some non-agentive uses; if so, it's likely that it will actually be applicativised **tza'ch** that gets used in those new contexts.

(A brief look under the hood. I'm actually thinking of **tza'** as inherently zero-transitive, with no selected arguments. At the same time, I'm supposing that there's a rule that a verb must surface with at least one argument, with the default being that an agent is added if nothing has been. So applicative **-ch** not only adds a patient argument, it also prevents the default agent argument from getting added---which is why you then need the overt transitivising suffix **-s** to get an agent.)

# tza'·tza' (the participle)

**tza'** can form a participle by full reduplication. I write this **tza'·tza'** because for some purposes the prosodic boundary between the reduplicants is worth marking.

This is what I call a circumstantial participle. Circumstantial participles are not oriented towards event participants; in this case that means that **tza'·tza'** does not describe the person who runs.

**tza'·tza'** can be used as a sort of manner adverb:

    (21) ù   qichʼím  tza'·tza'  os  no   yóròq 
         go  Qichim   running    to  DET  shrine
         ""Qichim went running to the shrine""

It can also be used adnominally with a small number of nouns. For example:

    (22) tʼaam  tza'·tza'
         place  running  
         ""place for running, race course""

**hóch tza'·tza'** '*running person*' is possible, but not with the meaning you might expect. It can't describe a person who is running, but if, say, there's a day of competitions, the **hóch tza'·tza'** might be the person in charge of the races.

I'm pretty sure that **tza'·tza'**, and Patches participles in general, cannot be used as predicates. (This makes them quite unusual, since Patches allows most content words to function as predicates.)

# Plurals

Many Patches verbs can form verbal plurals, either by initial **CV-** reduplication or with the suffix **-owi**. But only verbs that select patient arguments have plurals, so this is possible not for **tza'** itself but only for some of the verbs derived from it. We have the following forms:

* **tza'·mowi** '*run:MID:PL*'
* **tza'·chowi** '*run:APPL:PL*'
* **tza'che·sowi** '*run:APPL:CAUS:PL*'
* **tza''a·mowi** '*run:PUNC:MID:PL*'
* **tza''a·chowi** '*run:PUNC:APPL:PL*'
* **tza''ache.sowi** '*run:PUNC:APPL:PL*'

The semantics of these forms is not very surprising (or at least I haven't figured out anything very interesting to say about them). They can only be used with a plural patient, but that's not enough; they also imply that the event described by the verb is itself somehow plural. Here's an example with a middle:

    (23) tza'mowiy        wothus
         run:MID:PL:3p.B  tired 
         Intended: ""They ran themselves tired""

This would be appropriate only as a description of some people who, independently of one another, ran themselves tired; a single group running together and becoming tired together would be described instead as **tza'mi** '*run:MID:3p.B*,' without the verbal plural.

1436,0,"Hi everyone, 

I'm working on my first proper language and I'm following the Biblaridion youtube channel where he walks you through, step-by-step, creating a proto-language and evolving it with sound changes. I really like where I am so far and I'm really enjoying the process of phonetic and grammatical evolution.

An issue I just came to is that, through sound changes, some verb forms became identical to each other. For example the verb, ""to take"" \*Val\* conjugates to \*val(itu)\* as the future indicative, and \*valit(u)\* in the subjunctive habitual. This is because an older form of the verb case system had just 3 tenses, but also had a perfective/imperfective distinction and most of those forms got reinterpreted as tenses like ""habitual"" and ""perfect"" but the future perfective got reinterpreted as a simple future, and the old simple future became the root form of the subjunctive with the normalized endings for those tenses. So in the case of \*Val\* + \*itu\* is the future tense and \*Valit\* (old simple future) + the habitual ending \*u\* makes two identical words, ""Valitu,"" and ""Valitu"" one meaning ""will take"" and the other ""might usually be taking"" There are other such examples but I won't bore y'all, I think you get the point.

So my question, would this be something reasonably interpreted by speakers just from context? if not, how would you innovate for your fictional speakers a way to disambiguate these forms? Are there some things more likely to be ok left to context and other things where it would be very rare for a language to not distinguish? 

Many thanks for your time, and if anyone wants additional information I'm happy to provide, I just tried to only provide the necessary details and this post still feels long so there you go.  :)","Ambiguous verb case, would speakers innovate or infer from context?","Hi everyone,

1452,0,"I'm trying to make a PIE-esque language family from a PIE-esque proto. The first two languages I'm deriving from it are supposed to have a Hungarian aesthetic (Gyov) and a Greek aesthetic (Argoian? Argotide? Arges? I can't decide on a name, but I want it to start with ""Arg-""). And I want the grammar to be monstrously complicated, but in somewhat different ways from PIE.

But I'm having trouble settling on a verb system I like. Here I will describe what I have so far.

The phonological inventory is more or less what you would expect from PIE, plus some additional stuff. It includes PIE's theorized three laryngeals \**h₁*, \**h₂* and \**h₃*, for which I assume the reconstructions \*/h/, \*/ʕ/ and \*/ɣʷ/ with syllabic counterparts \*/ə/, \*/ɑ/ and \*/ɵ/ respectively, but additionally, Proto-Arg-whatever has 3 mystery *liquids* \**r₁* (neutral), \**r₂* (i-coloring) and \**r₃* (a-coloring), which are typically reconstructed as \*/r̥/, \*/ɺ ~ lʲ/ and \*/ɹ ~ ʁ/ respectively. On top of PIE's palatovelar series, this proto also has a palatoalveolar (or palatalized alveolar?) series \**t́*, \**d́*, and \**d́ʰ*.

A couple decisions I came to fairly early on that impact the verb system:

- The proto distinguishes singular vs. dual vs. plural. Many, but not *most*, daughter languages will retain the dual.

- The proto *does not* distinguish 2nd vs. 3rd person - there is just 1st person vs. non-1st person (conventionally notated 3rd person from here on out). Almost all daughter languages will derive 2nd or 3rd person pronouns from somewhere to fill the lexical gap, but as of this point in history, they don't exist yet.

- The proto is *maybe* technically tenseless. At least, there is no marking I have definitively decided marks tense, but there is a lot that marks aspect and mood. As of now, aspect/mood combinations are what reflex as specific tenses in the daughter languages.

- In particular, the proto distinguishes realis vs. irrealis vs. subjunctive moods (yes, I know subjunctive *is* an irrealis mood), and stative vs. perfective vs. imperfective aspects. Some language repurpose realis vs. irrealis as present vs. past or affirmative vs. negative; statives generally become either present or perfect tenses.

- There *is* noun gender, but it's not reflected in the verb system.

- 3 moods x 3 aspects x 2 grammatical persons x 3 grammatical numbers = 54 total endings. The current iteration of them is given below:

Realis | Stative | Imperfective | Perfective
:--|:--|:--|:--
**1.SG** | \**-ō* | \**-om* | \**-os*
**1.DU** | \**-ou* | \**-owom* | \**-owos*
**1.PL** | \**-oygʰi* | \**-bʰu* | \**-bʰos*
**3.SG** | \**-i* | \**-m* | \**-s*
**3.DU** | \**-yo* | \**-yom* | \**-is*
**3.PL** | \**-ti* | \**-tom* | \**-tos*

Irrealis | Stative | Imperfective | Perfective
:--|:--|:--|:--
**1.SG** | \**-ē* | \**-em* | \**-es*
**1.DU** | \**-eh₃* | \**-oym* | \**-wis*

**3.SG** | \**-eh₁e* | \**-eh₁m* | \**-eis*
**3.DU** | \**-eh₂* | \**-teh₂m* | \**-h₂is*
**3.PL** | \**-or₁* | \**-er₁* | \**-er₁s*

**3.DU** | \**-nh₂* | \**-dʰwh₂* | \**-th₂es*
**3.PL** | \**-nti* | \**-ntu* | \**-nis*

I wanted them to be somewhat regularly patterned, not completely random, but not *so* regular that they could be decomposed into two agglutinative affixes stuck together. I wanted it to be fusional from the beginning.

But, if there's one thing I notice about PIE, it's that it seems to have a way of being able to derive many many very different-looking, very non-obvious doublets from the same very productive root. To help with that, and in the service of making the grammar even more complicated just for complexity's sake, I started throwing in some random grammatical machinery to increase the variability of results I could get from a single stem when run through the sound changes. There are three main ways as of yet to tinker with the stem to produce different effects.

So first, let's talk about *grades*, wherein a single stem can take multiple forms that vary by the number of morae its nucleus takes up. PIE does this, AFAIK, by having stems alternate between having \**e* (e-grade), \**o* (o-grade), or a syllabic resonant as the nucleus (zero-grade).

I'm not, like, wedded to the idea of copying PIE's idea of grades, but I'm having a hard time thinking of how else a daughter language with a single, deterministic sound change ruleset can effect such a diversity of reflexes and doublets from a single stem, other than... just changing the stem to begin with. Hence grades.

But rather than assigning grades by *quality*, I've been assigning them by *length* - that is, 0-grade is the stem with a nucleus with 0 vowel morae (i.e., syllabic resonant nucleus), 1-grade has 1 vowel mora, i.e. a single short vowel, 2-grade has 2 vowel morae, i.e. a long vowel or 2 short vowels in a diphthong, etc.

The other two elements to add some variability are the transitive markers (TR) and the ""stem formant"" (a name I stole from old description of Georgian grammar for what we would today call the ""thematic affix"") or just ""formant"" for short. 

Perhaps the transitive markers would be better called ""thematic vowels"" since I haven't settled on whether they actually mark transitivity or not, but I called them that because I got the idea to add them in from Urartian, in which you have to explicitly mark the valency of a verb between the stem and person markers: *-a-/-i-* for intransitive, *-u-* for transitive. And it occurs to me they might also resemble Georgian ""versioners"", which sometimes have a role in Georgian's polypersonalism in marking benefactive arguments, and sometimes... not, and have no particular meaning, and just have to be memorized with the verb.

But anyway, instead of 3 such vowels like in Urartian or Georgian, I came up with 3 *sets* of 3: {\**e*, \**o*, \**i*}, {\**h₂e*, \**h₂o*, \**h₂i*}, {\**wē*, \**wō*, \**woy*}. And I'm not really sure... what the difference between the three sets should be. Maybe:

- The set is determined by the mood, and the element is determined by the valency

- The set is determined by the valency, and the element is determined by whatever subjectively sounds better

- The set is determined by ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ and the element is determined by the mood

The ""formant"" is just some consonant - placed after the transitive marker if they cooccur - that is consistently mapped to a stem; that is, if the formant occurs, the stem will always use the same formant. One formant per stem. Currently I have {\**t*, \**k*, \**t́*, \**ḱ*, \**mn*, \**r₁*, \**s*} as options since they seem to produce reflexes I like.

Okay, so to put them all together, I thought of multiple different ways of mixing and matching these elements; I grouped these elements by some vague idea of ""length"", where a 0-grade stem has a length of 1, +1 for each additional grade, and +1 for each additional element beyond the stem, like so:

- (len 3) 0-grade +TR +formant

- (len 3) 1-grade +TR

- (len 3) 1-grade +formant

- (len 4) 1-grade +TR +formant

- (len 4) 2-grade +TR

- (len 4) 2-grade +formant

- (len 5) augment (*é*) + 1-grade +TR +formant

- (len 5) 2-grade +TR +formant

I probably won't use all of them. It's conceivable that they might be used to mark a tense distinction, or just different verb classes just to fuck with people, or something like that.

To give an example of how all 8 reflex in both Classical Argoian and Early Modern Gyov, I will use the stem \**h₃etḱ-* ""to scold; to rebuke; to chastise"", formant \**-mn-*, transitivizer, mmm, let's say \**-h₂i-*, and let's use \**-ou-* 1.DU.REAL.STAT. Running all 8 of these forms through the sound changes:
	
\**h₃tḱ-h₂i-mn-ou* → *oktaimno, uttyhunó*

\**h₃etḱ-h₂i-ou* → *ektaio, jöttyhű*

\**h₃etḱ-mn-ou* → *ektamno, jönnytő*

\**h₃etḱ-h₂i-mn-ou* → *ektaimno, jöttyhinő*

\**h₃ētḱ-h₂i-ou* → *ēktaio, jőttyhű*

\**h₃ētḱ-mn-ou* → *ēktamno, jőnnytő*

\**e-h₃etḱ-h₂i-mn-ou* → *eoiktaimno, ejöttyhönő*

\**h₃ētḱ-h₂i-mn-ou* → *ēktaimno, jőttyhönő*

And the question is, essentially, how many of these should actually mean something? And what?",Description of a WIP proto verb system I've been working on,"I'm trying to make a PIE-esque language family from a PIE-esque proto. The first two languages I'm deriving from it are supposed to have a Hungarian aesthetic (Gyov) and a Greek aesthetic (Argoian? Argotide? Arges? I can't decide on a name, but I want it to start with ""Arg-""). And I want the grammar to be monstrously complicated, but in somewhat different ways from PIE.

But I'm having trouble settling on a verb system I like. Here I will describe what I have so far.

The phonological inventory is more or less what you would expect from PIE, plus some additional stuff. It includes PIE's theorized three laryngeals \**h₁*, \**h₂* and \**h₃*, for which I assume the reconstructions \*/h/, \*/ʕ/ and \*/ɣʷ/ with syllabic counterparts \*/ə/, \*/ɑ/ and \*/ɵ/ respectively, but additionally, Proto-Arg-whatever has 3 mystery *liquids* \**r₁* (neutral), \**r₂* (i-coloring) and \**r₃* (a-coloring), which are typically reconstructed as \*/r̥/, \*/ɺ ~ lʲ/ and \*/ɹ ~ ʁ/ respectively. On top of PIE's palatovelar series, this proto also has a palatoalveolar (or palatalized alveolar?) series \**t́*, \**d́*, and \**d́ʰ*.

A couple decisions I came to fairly early on that impact the verb system:

- The proto distinguishes singular vs. dual vs. plural. Many, but not *most*, daughter languages will retain the dual.

- The proto *does not* distinguish 2nd vs. 3rd person - there is just 1st person vs. non-1st person (conventionally notated 3rd person from here on out). Almost all daughter languages will derive 2nd or 3rd person pronouns from somewhere to fill the lexical gap, but as of this point in history, they don't exist yet.

- The proto is *maybe* technically tenseless. At least, there is no marking I have definitively decided marks tense, but there is a lot that marks aspect and mood. As of now, aspect/mood combinations are what reflex as specific tenses in the daughter languages.

- In particular, the proto distinguishes realis vs. irrealis vs. subjunctive moods (yes, I know subjunctive *is* an irrealis mood), and stative vs. perfective vs. imperfective aspects. Some language repurpose realis vs. irrealis as present vs. past or affirmative vs. negative; statives generally become either present or perfect tenses.

- There *is* noun gender, but it's not reflected in the verb system.

- 3 moods x 3 aspects x 2 grammatical persons x 3 grammatical numbers = 54 total endings. The current iteration of them is given below:

Realis | Stative | Imperfective | Perfective

I wanted them to be somewhat regularly patterned, not completely random, but not *so* regular that they could be decomposed into two agglutinative affixes stuck together. I wanted it to be fusional from the beginning.

But, if there's one thing I notice about PIE, it's that it seems to have a way of being able to derive many many very different-looking, very non-obvious doublets from the same very productive root. To help with that, and in the service of making the grammar even more complicated just for complexity's sake, I started throwing in some random grammatical machinery to increase the variability of results I could get from a single stem when run through the sound changes. There are three main ways as of yet to tinker with the stem to produce different effects.

So first, let's talk about *grades*, wherein a single stem can take multiple forms that vary by the number of morae its nucleus takes up. PIE does this, AFAIK, by having stems alternate between having \**e* (e-grade), \**o* (o-grade), or a syllabic resonant as the nucleus (zero-grade).

I'm not, like, wedded to the idea of copying PIE's idea of grades, but I'm having a hard time thinking of how else a daughter language with a single, deterministic sound change ruleset can effect such a diversity of reflexes and doublets from a single stem, other than... just changing the stem to begin with. Hence grades.

But rather than assigning grades by *quality*, I've been assigning them by *length* - that is, 0-grade is the stem with a nucleus with 0 vowel morae (i.e., syllabic resonant nucleus), 1-grade has 1 vowel mora, i.e. a single short vowel, 2-grade has 2 vowel morae, i.e. a long vowel or 2 short vowels in a diphthong, etc.

The other two elements to add some variability are the transitive markers (TR) and the ""stem formant"" (a name I stole from old description of Georgian grammar for what we would today call the ""thematic affix"") or just ""formant"" for short.

- (len 4) 2-grade +formant

- (len 5) augment (*é*) + 1-grade +TR +formant

- (len 5) 2-grade +TR +formant

The latter is not as serious as it sounds: Ketoshaya has optional additional mood markers that further specify the mood of an irrealis verb (conditional, imperative, jussive, etc.) and these would be more aggressively used in the present tense if context did not make mood otherwise obvious.

1472,0,"The ancestor language of my small conlang family, **Old Kerguelenese**, has a special grammatical category, called state. Basically, nouns may appear in a variety of “states” depending on their grammatical function in a sentence, and Old Kerguelenese nouns have four states, which I call **absolute, independent, costruct** and **conjunct**. 

&amp;#x200B;

The **absolute** state (which should not be confused with the absolutive case) is the most basic form of the noun, which is a bare stem without an ending. It is a relatively uncommon state, mostly used to mark the predicate of a nominal sentence or a identify someone or something being adressed.

&amp;#x200B;

“This man is a friend” – *ɣīlis s**^(2)**is azpalat*.

| ɣīl-i-s | s^(2)\-i-s | azpalat |
|:-|:-|:-|
|man-independent-PROX|this-independent-PROX|friend.absolute|
|\[ ˈɣiː.lis\] |\[sʷis\]|\[ɑs.ˈpɑlɑtʰ\]|

Here, the word *azpaltu* (“friend”) is in the absolute state, while *ɣīli* (“man”) is in the independent state. The copula *a* (“to be”) is optional.

&amp;#x200B;

 “This person is my sibling” – *a ini·k gʷir*.

|a|ini-k|gʷir|
|:-|:-|:-|
|3sg.be|sibling.construct-1sg|person.absolute|
|\[ɑ\]|\[ˈi.nikʰ\]|\[kʷiɦ\]|

In this example, the word *ini* (“sibling”) is in the construct state.

&amp;#x200B;

“Come here, little one” – *pām, a·gittan*.

|pām|a-gi-il-ran|
|:-|:-|
|be.little.absolute|IMP-IRR-DET-go|
|\[pʰɑːm\]|\[ɑ.ˈgit.tɑn\]|

Here, the word *pām* (“little one”) is in the absolute state, because it's a vocative expression.

&amp;#x200B;

The **independent** state is the most common, it is also the dictionary form of a word complete with an ending. Here is an example of a sentence, in which all nouns are in the independent state:

&amp;#x200B;

“The man saw a penguin” – *ɣīlis kʷapu ai·ɣain.*

&amp;#x200B;

|ɣīl-i-s |kʷap-u|a-i-ɣ-ain|
|:-|:-|:-|
|man-independent-PROX|penguin-independent|3S-3O-DET-see.PST|
|\[ ˈɣiː.lis\] | \[ˈkʷʰɑ.pʰu\]|\[ɑɪ.ˈɣɑɪn\]|

The **construct** and **conjunct** states often appear together. Most words do not have distinct conjunct and construct forms in Old Kerguelenese (the conjunct state was marked by lenition of the initial consonant), and both are usually identical to the independent form. Both states are used to indicate possession or when one noun describes another and forms a compound with it: 

&amp;#x200B;

“A woman's son” –  *ma**ł**i·bana.*

|mał-i|ban-a|
|:-|:-|
|son-construct|woman-conjunct|
|\[ ˈmɑ.ʟi\]|\[ˈβɑ.nɑ\]|

“I live down by the river” – *mi·gā**ł* *xa·s**^(2)**unu*.

|mi-gāł|xa-s^(2)un-u|
|:-|:-|
|1sg.DYN-live|along-river-conjunct|
|\[mi.ˈgɑːʟ\]|\[xɑ.ˈfu.nu\]|

Later, in most dialects of Kerguelenese the conjunct state became obsolete. Instead, a coverb particle became widely used, for example South Kerguelenese: *at h·jāta sune* \[ɑt. ˈçjɑː.tɑ. ˈsu.nə\] (“I live near the river”, lit. “I'm along-living the river"").

&amp;#x200B;

Today's word - let's do a verb this time - is **to betray**, vt. - *to deliver someone or something into the hands of an enemy, or expose them to danger of an enemy, in violation of some trust previously placed in the doer.*

-------------------------------------------------

Equivalent to *be-* + *tray*. *be-* being a prefix of Germanic origin with many meanings, probably here using its causative sense of ""to make; to cause to be; to become""; from the unstressed form of Old English *bī-*, from Proto-Germanic \**bi(-)* ""near; around; at"", from zero-grade of PIE \**h₁epi* ""on; at; near"". Doublet of *by*.

*tray* part from Old French *trair* (Modern French *trahir*), from Latin *trādere* ""to give up; to hand over; to surrender; to bequeath to posterity; to impart"", equivalent to *trāns* ""over; across; beyond"" (from PIE \**terh₂-* ""to cross over; to pass through"", whence also English *through*) + *dare* ""to give"" (from PIE \**deh₃-* ""to give"").  *Possibly* a doublet of modern English *trade*, from Old Saxon *trada*, depending on if and when *trādere* was borrowed from Latin into a Germanic forebear.

(Also, from going through the Wiktionary etymologies for other languages, it seems like ""to sell out""/""to give over"" is a very common etymology for ""to betray"".

||Bilabial|Dental|Palatalized|Post alveolar|Velar|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Plosives/affricates|p, (b)|t, (d)| t͡ɕ | t̠͡ʃ |k, (g)|
|Nasals|m|n| ɲ || ŋ |
|Sibilant||s| ɕ | ʃ |x|
|Spirants|| ð | ðʲ |||
|Lateral||l| ʎ |||
|Thrills||r||||
|Semivowels|w||j|||

Voiced stops are at the end of closed syllables (the syllable structure being CVC)

Here are the changes :

# First stage :

{æɑ} &gt; a

ɯ &gt; i

t͡ʃ, ʃ &gt; t͡s, s

b, d, g &gt; β, ð, ɣ

t͡ɕ, ɕ, ɲ, ðʲ, ʎ &gt; t͡ɕ, ɕ, ɲ, {ʑ, ʎ} &gt; t͡ʃ, ʃ, n, ʒ

β, ð &gt; v, zp &gt; f / #\_

t, k, x, ɣ &gt; t͡ʃ, c, ç, ʝ / \_{E, a}

iw, ow, aw, {uw, ew} &gt; y ː , ø ː , o ː , u ː 

{ij, uj}, oj, {aj, ej} &gt; i ː ,  u ː , e ː 

{w, j} &gt; ∅ / V\_ / V\_V

w, j &gt; v, ʒŋ &gt; n / \_#ŋ &gt; ɲ / \_V

Intervocalic voicing

{ptk}p, {ptk}t, {ptk}k &gt; p ː , t ː , k ː 

&amp;#x200B;

# Second stage :

ks &gt; ʃ / V\_V

{ks, t͡s},  d͡z, kv, tv, kʒ &gt; s ː , z  ː  , t ː , p ː , c͡ç

Np, Nt, Nk &gt; p ː , t ː , k ː / but not for already elongated stops

p ː , t ː , k ː , s ː , z  ː  &gt; f, θ, x, s, z

i ː , y ː , u ː , e ː , ø ː , o ː &gt; ei, øy, ou, ɛi, œy, ɔu

e, o &gt; ɛ, ɔ / \_{tnszlr}

ŋ &gt; g

n &gt; ŋ / \_{kgxɣ}

l &gt; ʎ

r &gt; l / \_ / C\_

θ &gt; r

n, m, {s, x} &gt; r, n, ∅

a &gt; e / n\_#

e &gt; a / r\_#

e &gt; i / m\_# 

# Third stage 

(this stage is a big clusterf\*ck that I made only to add big differences between the conlang and other Uralic languages, I just want to know if that kind of clusterf\*ck is possible)

c, c͡ç, ɟ, ç, ʝ &gt; ʈ, ʈ͡ʂ, ɖ, ʂ, ʐ

k, g, x, ɣ &gt; c, ɟ, ç, ʝ

t, d, s, z &gt; k, g, x, ɣ

ʈ, ʈ͡ʂ, ɖ, ʂ, ʐ &gt; t, t͡s, d, s, z

ou, øy, ei, ɛi, ɔu, œy &gt; o, ø, e, ɛ, ɔ, œ

x, ɣ &gt; h, ɦ / \_C

e, ø, o &gt; ɛ, œ, ɔ

&amp;#x200B;

So, at the end, we end up getting a chart like this :

&amp;#x200B;

||Bilabial|Dental|Palatal|Post alveolar|Velar|Glottal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Plosives/affricates|p, b|t, d,  t͡s | c,  c͡ç, ɟ | t̠͡ʃ,  d͡ʒ |k, g||

1493,0,"Basically I was doing a bit of research into R'lyehian, which is the ""language"" H.P Lovecraft had made for his weird tales, the thing is

1. it's phonology is basically just english with a glottal stop

2. It's word order (isn't listed) but it seems like it's just SVO

So I said ""fuck it I can do better than that"" so I did...

Now if it's better or not I can't guarantee, but it's something, so let's first go to the...

**Phonology**

Too much, I'll set up an image here

[part 1](https://preview.redd.it/lqggf8pykak81.png?width=1265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b766ce891a61e3892e852c3f2fec5d4b4d0c1472)

Then the other sounds which I can do here being

w, ʍ, n͡m, ŋ͡m, t͡p, d͡b, k͡p, ɡ͡b, which I romanized as &lt;w, ẘ, nm, n̈m, tp, db, kp, gb&gt;

Long vowels just get macrons

**Technical Stuff**

Alright now the fun part, where it gets *painful*

Word Order: Fluxuating Word Order Depending on the Gender of the Subject, Object, and Verb, by the way there are 5 genders, and 20 subgenders that serve no purpose... except for potential irregularities

Fluxuating Adjective Placement AND Possession Placement based on the same exact thing

**Deeper Technical Stuff**

There are 8 Grammatical Numbers, although if there's more please tell me, those being Dual, Trial, Quadral, Paucal, Distributive, Plural, Superplural, and Collective

There are 13 Tenses, those being Far Past, Past, Near Past, Present, (it's necessary) Perfect, Imperfect, Imperfect*ive*, (which I think is different) Hypothetical, Continuous, Pluperfect, Near Future, Future, and Far Future, if there's more please tell me

Oh yeah each ""gender"" has their own variations of number and tense, and yes a bit of my soul rotted making all of them

There are affixes for marking if a noun is an adjective, and yes I said *affixes* because there are both Suffixes and Prefixes, and the difference is entirely random

If two words with the same gender are next to each other, then they undergo agglutination via a plethora of morphemes that connect Subjects, Verbs, and Objects together in different funky orders

That's about it technicality-wise, now lets get onto the words

**Lexicon**

Before we actually get into our Not-nomicom lexicon let's use the original source material as a comparrison

1496,0,"I live in Southern Florida where three languages are predominant: English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole. I wanted to see what a creole language combining the three would look and sound like in terms of phonology, lexicon, and grammar. One of my smaller goals was to make it very grammatically consistent and lexically small to make it realistic and easy to learn and create. This is the result of my efforts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Phonology**

Consonants:

||Labial|Alveolar|Palatal/Velar|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Plosive|p b|t d|k g|
|Nasal|  m|  n||
|Rhotic||  r||
|Fricative|f|s| ʃ &lt;sh&gt;|
|Approximant|  w|  l|  j &lt;y&gt;|

&amp;#x200B;

Vowels:

||Front|Central|Back|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Close|i||  u|
|Mid|e||  o|
|||a||

&amp;#x200B;

Phonotactics:

Syllable structure is (C)(L)V(C) where (L) stands for liquid (/r w l j/).

&amp;#x200B;

**Syntax**

Word order occurs as follows:

Subject-verb-object

Adjective-noun

Degree-adjective

Verb-adverb

Genitive-noun

&amp;#x200B;

**Morphology**

Nouns:

plural    -s when ending in vowel, -os when ending in consonant

genitive (possessive)    -n when ending in vowel, -on when ending in consonant

&amp;#x200B;

Verbs:

past    -te

future    fil- (basically functions as ""will"" or ""voy""

&amp;#x200B;

**Grammar**

Yes/no questions are indicated with negation. For example:

Is that your dog? (English Example)

Tas es un no un dok? (Spanglatian Translation)

that is you-POS NEG you-POS dog (Literal Meaning)

The negation between the key question word indicates the question's yes/no quality. This functions similar to yes/no questions in Mandarin Chinese (completely unrelated but if you know the language it might make more sense now than with my poor explanation).

&amp;#x200B;

**Lexicon**

I'm not going to include the full lexicon here (unless highly requested, then I may post a link) but I'll explain the word-derivation process used:

1. Find word.
2. See if word can be broken down. For example, ""phone"" can become ""hand machine"" and still make sense.
3. Translate word(s) into the three source languages and see where they line up phonologically.
4. Double check word(s) is/are pronounceable by speakers of all three languages and add to lexicon!

*Example:*

Desired word is ""chant,"" ""say,"" or ""sing.""

English: chant \[t͡ʃeənt\]

Spanish: canta \[kanta\]

Creole: chante \[ʃãte\]

Spanglatian: shanta \[ʃanta\]

&amp;#x200B;

**Sentence Examples**

Hello! As the question above asks, does the chart above look as though the consonants can logically be used? Are there too few/many, or perhaps certain sounds that would logically be present with these? Likewise, do the romanizations make sense? I'm sorry if these seem like silly questions, but I'm trying to work out the basics of my book's fictional language Etheric (mostly the phonology, grammar, and some words; i don't need much more than that for the sake of the story) but I want it to at least seem logical!  


Any and all feedback is appreciated! You were all so helpful on my last post, so I thank you in advance!",Does this set of consonants look like they'd work well as the only consonant sounds of Etheric?,"&amp;#x200B;

## [Headedness, again (Polinsky)](http://phonetics.linguistics.ucla.edu/wpl/issues/wpl17/papers/40_polinsky.pdf)

This week's paper was submitted by my friend u/roipoiboy and presents another look at headedness in combination with the noun-verb ratio in various languages. Being probably one of the first typological notions many conlangers encounter, headedness talks about the order of heads and their dependents. While a strict dichotomy between head-initial and head-final is often propagated among conlangers, it's really more of a spectrum, at least according to this paper. Now let's move onto the prompts:

* What headedness type does your language classify as?
    * Is it rather head-final or head-initial?
    * What constituent orders does your language exhibit?
* What are the distributional properties of nouns and verbs like?
* How do nouns and verbs differ? In what ways are they the same?

1518,0,"# Introduction to Kaweroi

Kaweroi is a language spoken on the fictional Targean continent. It belongs to the Achken language family, one of three main families on the continent. The language has SVO word order, and is strongly head-initial and head marking.

**Phonology**

Kaweroi has a fairly simple phonology, with a voicing distinction in stops and affricates and a four vowel system.

||Bilabial|Alveolar|Post-Alveolar|Velar|Labialized Velar|Glottal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nasal|m|n|||||
|Stop|p b|t d||k g|kʷ &lt;kw&gt;|ʔ &lt;h&gt;|
|Affricate||ts|tʃ  dʒ &lt;ch, j&gt;||||
|Fricative||s|ʃ &lt;sh&gt;|||h|
|Liquid|| ɾ/l|j &lt;y&gt;||w||

&amp;#x200B;

||Front|Back|
|:-|:-|:-|
|High|i, i: &lt;í&gt;||
|Mid|e, e: &lt;é&gt;|o, o: &lt;ó&gt;|
|Low|a, a: &lt;á&gt;||

**Phonotactics**

Kaweroi has a (C)V(C)(C) syllable structure. /b, d, g, kʷ, dʒ/ and /h/ cannot end a syllable, while any sound can start a syllable. The only permissible consonant clusters are a nasal + stop/affricate, or a fricative/affricate + stop/affricate. All consonants except those that cannot end a syllable and /w, j, ʔ/ can be geminate between vowels. 

Words are generally stressed on the 3rd to last mora of the root. Closed syllables and syllables with long vowels count as 2 mora, while syllables with both count as 3 mora.

**Allophony**

The phonemes /ɾ/ and /l/ are allophones of each other: the phoneme is realized as /l/ when in coda position or geminated, and /ɾ/ elsewhere.

The phoneme /ʔ/ can only occur word finally. In many dialects, it is lost entirely or realized as causing tone on the preceding vowel. Lastly, /e/ and /o/ become /ɛ/ and /ɔ/ in closed, unstressed syllables.

# Nouns

All nouns are categorized as either animate or inanimate. Animate nouns inflect for singular, dual, and plural number, while inanimate nouns can only be singular or plural. The plural ending causes certain final consonants to voice or change form.

||Animate|Inanimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Singular|\-∅ |\-∅ |
|Dual|\-(e)ts|\---|
|Plural|\-(e)t|\-(o)n|

In addition, nouns can take the locative ending -(w)eh, which is used with indirect objects and with certain prepositions. This ending is placed after number marking.

**Possession**

To show possession, the genitive particle *o* is used. The particle is placed between the possessor and the possessed noun, for example: *kiwa o ino* ""The man's dog"", where *kiwa* means ""man"".

Instead of possessive adjectives like English ""my, your"" etc., Kaweroi uses the same possessive construction with a pronoun, for example: *he o ino* ""My dog"", where *he* means ""I"".

# Verbs

Verbs in Kaweroi are much more complex than nouns. They inflect for subject and object, tense, voice, aspect, and mood. The affixes on a verb always appear in a fixed order:

*subject &gt; mood &gt; aspect &gt; root &gt; tense &gt; negation &gt; voice &gt; object*

**Subject Agreement Prefixes**

||*Singular*|*Dual*|*Plural*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1st Inclusive|\---|chits(e)-|chi(h)-|
|1st Exclusive|h(e)-|nots(e)-|no(w)-|
|2nd|k(a)-|yots(e)-|yo(w)-|
|3rd Animate|∅-|gats(e)-|ga(d)-|
|3rd Inanimate|w-/o-|\---|in(e)-|
|3rd Switch-Referent|sh(e)-|\---|\---|
|Indefinite|ma(d)-|\---|\---|

The switch referent 3rd person pronoun is used when there are two 3rd person arguments of the same animacy. If the next verb has a 3rd person subject, it will use the switch-referent marker if the subject is *different* than the proceeding verb.

*kiwa ínenet chigon, deh* ***sh****ókíchitane* ""The man saw the woman, and then the woman left."" The switch referent marker tells us that the object of the previous verb is the subject of the verb.

**Object Agreement Suffixes**

||*Singular*|*Dual*|*Plural*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1st Inclusive|\---|\-(a)chits|\-(a)chi|
|1st Exclusive|\-(h)e|\-(e)nots|\-(e)won|
|2nd|\-(e)ga|\-(e)yots|\-(e)yo|
|3rd Animate|\-(i)t|\-(a)gits|\-(a)gi|
|3rd Inanimate|\-∅|\---|\-(i)n|
|Reflexive|\-(e)nit|\---|\---|
|Reciprocal|\-(o)mis|\---|\---|
|Indefinite|\-∅|\---|\---|

**Tense**

Kaweroi verbs inflect for two tenses: past and non-past. There are two past tense suffixes: *-ne* and        -*nien.* The first is used for events the speaker witnessed directly, while the second is for events witnessed secondhand. When the past tense marker is affixed to a word ending in a consonant, the suffix is realized differently depending on the consonant. This usually involves metathesis.

Example: *hellowit* ""I hunt"" &gt; *hellowinde* ""I hunted"".   *-t + ne &gt; -nde*

**Voice**

Kaweroi verbs can inflect for both passive and causative voice. The passive voice marker is *-da* while the causative voice marker is *-(w)is.* The passive voice marker changes form if affixed to a word ending in a consonant, like the past tense. 

*hellowit* ""I hunt"" &gt; *hellowitta* ""I am hunted"".   *-t + da &gt; -tta*

The causative voice causes final consonants to voice or change form just like plural marking does.

**Aspect**

Kaweroi has various aspect suffixes which can be prefixed to the verb.

|*Aspect*|*Prefix*|
|:-|:-|
|Progressive|on(a)-|
|Habitual|we-|
|Inchoative|kwé(h)-|
|Resultative|ts(i)-|

**Mood**

Kaweroi also has 7 moods indicated by prefixes on the verb:

|*Mood*|*Prefix*|
|:-|:-|
|Conditional|j(i)-|
|Potential|nap(a)-|
|Necessitative|nai(d)-|
|Volitional|d(o)-|
|Optative|eyá(h)-|
|Presumptive|shos(o)-|
|Dubitative|ro(w)-|

# Adjectives

Adjectives do not form a distinct word class from nouns: all adjectives can be used on their own as nouns, or can become nouns when certain suffixes are attached.

*Ex. kelton* means both ""tall"" and ""a tall thing"". If the suffix -(m)et is added, it becomes *keltonet* ""a tall person, one who is tall"".

Adjectives always follow the nouns they modify. This is one way they are distinguished from quantifiers (numbers, words like ""many"", ""few"", ""some""): these precede the nouns they modify. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that's all I have for now, hopefully this gave a good overview of the language. There are lots of parts I didn't get to cover: negation, imperatives, adverbs, verbal nouns, and relative clauses to name a few, but that'll have to be for a later date.

# Metrical Structure

Classical Patrinaic poetry is largely based upon a structure of alliterative verse very similar to those found in Old English and Old Norse. Alliteration, though typically defined as the repeated occurrence of a phoneme or set of phonemes at the *beginning* of a word, is defined in Classical Patrinaic as the repetition of phonemes between *stressed* syllables.

**Alliterative Rules**

The core features of Classical Patrinaic alliterative verse are as follows:

* A line of poetry or *phelnad* (lit.  furrow or hind-water), is divided into two hemistiches (also referred to as half-lines)
   * The first hemistich is called the 'a-verse' and the second the 'b-verse'
* A caesura or *aglarmel* (lit. breath) separates the hemistiches
* Each hemistich will almost always have two stressed syllables, known as 'beats'.
* The first beat of the b-verse must alliterate with one or both of the beats in the a-verse
* The second beat of the b-verse cannot alliterate with the b-verse's first beat, though it can alliterate with beats in the a-verse
* While it is preferred that the alliterated beats are the first syllable of their word, it is not required

In addition, all vowels alliterate with each other and with syllables beginning with the phoneme 'j', and all unaspirated stops alliterate with their aspirated counterparts (*p, t, and k* vs. *pʰ, tʰ, and kʰ*)\*.  
^(\*This aspiration rule had an interesting effect on the poetry of Classical Patrinaic's daughter languages. Many of those descendants lost their aspiration distinction with their aspirated consonants weakening to fricatives ()^(ɸ)^(, θ, and x specifically) instead. In an effort to reflect the poetry of Classical Patrinaic (which became, similarly to Latin, both a liturgical and a prestige language), poets allow unaspirated stops and fricatives of the same place of articulation to alliterate, such as with 'p' and ')^(ɸ'.)

**Stress Rules**

Tricks can be employed by poets to force certain syllables to become beats where they otherwise would not be. However, before this can be elaborated on, the stress rules of Patrinaic (which are, I think, relatively simple) must be defined:

* The final syllable in a word is referred to as the ultimate or ultima, the second-last as the penultimate or penult, and the third-to-last as the antepenultimate or antepenult
* The ultima is never stressed
* A syllable is treated as long if it contains a long vowel or ends in a consonant
   * Consonant clusters are always split between two syllables (eg. karbē -&gt; kar.bē) unless at the onset of the first syllable or at the coda of the final syllable
* If a syllable is not considered long then it is to be treated as short
* The penult is stressed if the syllable is long
* The antepenult is stressed if the penult is short

Furthermore, single-syllable words, postpositions, and pronouns have no inherent stress. However, postpositions have a very strong tendency to affix themselves to and therefore change the stress of the word they are modifying, as shown by the following examples. Stressed syllables are shown in bold.

&gt;**nī**milā  
sky.LOC:SG  
/'ni:.mɪ.la:/  
*in the sky*

In the example above, the antepenult 'nī' is the stressed syllable as the penult is short.

&gt;nīmi**lā** asag  
sky.LOC:SG under  
/ni:mɪ.'la:.sag/  
*under the sky*

However, in the following example, the postposition 'asag', though not reflected in the romanization,  is effectively suffixed onto 'nīmilā', deleting the postposition's initial 'a'. Since 'ni:' is no longer the antepenult and because the new penult 'la:' is long, it becomes the stressed syllable.

**Additional Poetic Tools**

As previously stated, postpositions often change the stress of the word they are modifying via affixation. However, sometimes a postposition that is needed to convey meaning can change a word's stress in an undesirable fashion. Take, for instance, the following phrase, in which the poet desires to have 'mīnosh' and mātem tel' alliterate. The stressed syllables will be bolded for ease of reading.

&gt;**mī**nosh    mā**tem** tel  
ring.NOM:PL    time.ACC:SG from  
/'mi:.noʃ    ma:.'tɛm.tɛl/  
*the ring    from time*

The postposition 'tel' is prohibiting 'mātem' from alliterating with 'mīnosh' though they both have syllables beginning with the phoneme 'm'. However, poets can employ the strategy seen in the following sentence to amend this issue.

&gt;**mī**nosh    tel **mā**tem  
ring.NOM:PL    from time.ACC:SG  
/'mi:.noʃ    tɛl.'ma:.tɛm/  
*the ring    from time*

The postposition's placement in the phrase has been shifted such that it precedes 'mātem' rather than succeeding it. As 'tel' is now a prefix rather than a suffix, the desired syllable is now the stressed syllable. These newly-changed adpositions are not required to be adjacent to the words they modify and can be placed anywhere in a clause, as in the example below.

&gt;Tel **mī**nosh    **mā**tem  
from ring.NOM:PL    time.ACC:S  
/tɛl 'mi:.noʃ    'ma:.tɛm/  
*the ring from    time*

Oftentimes, what an adposition is modifying remains unambiguous within the clause (poets tend to refrain from this strategy if there is ambiguity) as most can only modify one, two, or (very rarely) three noun cases. Furthermore, adpositions only affix themselves to a word if they are modifying them, hence why 'tel' in the above sentence is its own unstressed word rather than modifying 'mīnosh'.

A final strategy Patrin poets would employ is one they referred to as *Gūn Iorbuth* (lit. False Length). A poet using *Gūn Iorbuth* was permitted to change the length of up to one vowel per line to change a word's stress. In the romanization of Classical Patrinaic, the 'artificial lengthening' of a vowel is shown with a circumflex (â) while a vowel's 'artificial shortening' is shown with a breve (ă). Two sets of examples are below to demonstrate this with the first possessing artificial lengthening and the second having an artificial shortening. Both example sets will have stressed syllables bolded.

&gt;**mag**kharēs  
AUG.house.ACC:PL  
/'mag.kʰa.ɾe:s/  
*the halls*  
&gt;  
&gt;mag**khâ**rēs  
AUG.house.ACC:PL  
/mag.'kʰa:.ɾe:s/  
*the halls*

In the example below, 'egīn' means 'to lie (recline)' rather than 'to lie (deceive)'

&gt;e**gī**nōsh  
lie:PRS=NDEF:PL  
/ɛ.'gi:.no:ʃ/  
*is lying*  
&gt;  
&gt;**e**gĭnōsh  
lie:PRS=NDEF:PL  
/'ɛ.gɪ.no:ʃ/  
*is* *lying*

The second set of examples also contains an interesting choice worth noting. Typically, an ""intransitive"" (in quotations because no verbs are technically intransitive in Classical Patrinaic) verb like 'egīn' would take the reflexive enclitic '-hel' to form 'egīnhel', roughly translating to *it is lying itself.* However, using the reflexive enclitic would result in the syllable 'gīn' always being long regardless of vowel length, when the syllable 'e' needs to be alliterated. Therefore, the enclitic '-nosh', which marks an unknown/undefined plural object (and roughly meaning *some things are lying themselves*, is used to form the word 'egīnosh' instead, allowing for the syllable 'e' to be stressed assuming the long vowel is shortened. This usage of '-nosh' is technically grammatical even if a subject to the verb has been previously defined.

# Metrical Structure

Classical Patrinaic poetry is largely based upon a structure of alliterative verse very similar to those found in Old English and Old Norse. Alliteration, though typically defined as the repeated occurrence of a phoneme or set of phonemes at the *beginning* of a word, is defined in Classical Patrinaic as the repetition of phonemes between *stressed* syllables.

**Alliterative Rules**

The core features of Classical Patrinaic alliterative verse are as follows:

* A line of poetry or *phelnad* (lit.  furrow or hind-water), is divided into two hemistiches (also referred to as half-lines)
   * The first hemistich is called the 'a-verse' and the second the 'b-verse'
* A caesura or *aglarmel* (lit. breath) separates the hemistiches
* Each hemistich will almost always have two stressed syllables, known as 'beats'.
* The first beat of the b-verse must alliterate with one or both of the beats in the a-verse
* The second beat of the b-verse cannot alliterate with the b-verse's first beat, though it can alliterate with beats in the a-verse
* While it is preferred that the alliterated beats are the first syllable of their word, it is not required

In addition, all vowels alliterate with each other and with syllables beginning with the phoneme 'j', and all unaspirated stops alliterate with their aspirated counterparts (*p, t, and k* vs. *pʰ, tʰ, and kʰ*)\*.  
^(\*This aspiration rule had an interesting effect on the poetry of Classical Patrinaic's daughter languages. Many of those descendants lost their aspiration distinction with their aspirated consonants weakening to fricatives ()^(ɸ)^(, θ, and x specifically) instead. In an effort to reflect the poetry of Classical Patrinaic (which became, similarly to Latin, both a liturgical and a prestige language), poets allow unaspirated stops and fricatives of the same place of articulation to alliterate, such as with 'p' and ')^(ɸ'.)

**Stress Rules**

Tricks can be employed by poets to force certain syllables to become beats where they otherwise would not be. However, before this can be elaborated on, the stress rules of Patrinaic (which are, I think, relatively simple) must be defined:

* The final syllable in a word is referred to as the ultimate or ultima, the second-last as the penultimate or penult, and the third-to-last as the antepenultimate or antepenult
* The ultima is never stressed
* A syllable is treated as long if it contains a long vowel or ends in a consonant
   * Consonant clusters are always split between two syllables (eg. karbē -&gt; kar.bē) unless at the onset of the first syllable or at the coda of the final syllable
* If a syllable is not considered long then it is to be treated as short
* The penult is stressed if the syllable is long
* The antepenult is stressed if the penult is short

Furthermore, single-syllable words, postpositions, and pronouns have no inherent stress. However, postpositions have a very strong tendency to affix themselves to and therefore change the stress of the word they are modifying, as shown by the following examples. Stressed syllables are shown in bold.

&gt;**nī**milā  
sky.LOC:SG  
/'ni:.mɪ.la:/  
*in the sky*

In the example above, the antepenult 'nī' is the stressed syllable as the penult is short.

&gt;nīmi**lā** asag  
sky.LOC:SG under  
/ni:mɪ.'la:.sag/  
*under the sky*

However, in the following example, the postposition 'asag', though not reflected in the romanization,  is effectively suffixed onto 'nīmilā', deleting the postposition's initial 'a'. Since 'ni:' is no longer the antepenult and because the new penult 'la:' is long, it becomes the stressed syllable.

**Additional Poetic Tools**

As previously stated, postpositions often change the stress of the word they are modifying via affixation. However, sometimes a postposition that is needed to convey meaning can change a word's stress in an undesirable fashion. Take, for instance, the following phrase, in which the poet desires to have 'mīnosh' and mātem tel' alliterate. The stressed syllables will be bolded for ease of reading.

&gt;**mī**nosh    mā**tem** tel  
ring.NOM:PL    time.ACC:SG from  
/'mi:.noʃ    ma:.'tɛm.tɛl/  
*the ring    from time*

The postposition 'tel' is prohibiting 'mātem' from alliterating with 'mīnosh' though they both have syllables beginning with the phoneme 'm'. However, poets can employ the strategy seen in the following sentence to amend this issue.

&gt;**mī**nosh    tel **mā**tem  
ring.NOM:PL    from time.ACC:SG  
/'mi:.noʃ    tɛl.'ma:.tɛm/  
*the ring    from time*

The postposition's placement in the phrase has been shifted such that it precedes 'mātem' rather than succeeding it. As 'tel' is now a prefix rather than a suffix, the desired syllable is now the stressed syllable. These newly-changed adpositions are not required to be adjacent to the words they modify and can be placed anywhere in a clause, as in the example below.

&gt;Tel **mī**nosh    **mā**tem  
from ring.NOM:PL    time.ACC:S  
/tɛl 'mi:.noʃ    'ma:.tɛm/  
*the ring from    time*

Oftentimes, what an adposition is modifying remains unambiguous within the clause (poets tend to refrain from this strategy if there is ambiguity) as most can only modify one, two, or (very rarely) three noun cases. Furthermore, adpositions only affix themselves to a word if they are modifying them, hence why 'tel' in the above sentence is its own unstressed word rather than modifying 'mīnosh'.

A final strategy Patrin poets would employ is one they referred to as *Gūn Iorbuth* (lit. False Length). A poet using *Gūn Iorbuth* was permitted to change the length of up to one vowel per line to change a word's stress. In the romanization of Classical Patrinaic, the 'artificial lengthening' of a vowel is shown with a circumflex (â) while a vowel's 'artificial shortening' is shown with a breve (ă). Two sets of examples are below to demonstrate this with the first possessing artificial lengthening and the second having an artificial shortening. Both example sets will have stressed syllables bolded.

&gt;**mag**kharēs  
AUG.house.ACC:PL  
/'mag.kʰa.ɾe:s/  
*the halls*  
&gt;  
&gt;mag**khâ**rēs  
AUG.house.ACC:PL  
/mag.'kʰa:.ɾe:s/  
*the halls*

In the example below, 'egīn' means 'to lie (recline)' rather than 'to lie (deceive)'

&gt;e**gī**nōsh  
lie:PRS=NDEF:PL  
/ɛ.'gi:.no:ʃ/  
*is lying*  
&gt;  
&gt;**e**gĭnōsh  
lie:PRS=NDEF:PL  
/'ɛ.gɪ.no:ʃ/  
*is* *lying*

The second set of examples also contains an interesting choice worth noting. Typically, an ""intransitive"" (in quotations because no verbs are technically intransitive in Classical Patrinaic) verb like 'egīn' would take the reflexive enclitic '-hel' to form 'egīnhel', roughly translating to *it is lying itself.* However, using the reflexive enclitic would result in the syllable 'gīn' always being long regardless of vowel length, when the syllable 'e' needs to be alliterated. Therefore, the enclitic '-nosh', which marks an unknown/undefined plural object (and roughly meaning *some things are lying themselves*, is used to form the word 'egīnosh' instead, allowing for the syllable 'e' to be stressed assuming the long vowel is shortened. This usage of '-nosh' is technically grammatical even if a subject to the verb has been previously defined.

It's a great song anyway. 

I kept the meter of the song as best I could, so feel free to sing along in Mwaneḷe:

**totekwi ṭeŋi, ŋe enaka mekeŋi**

**eṭiḷe ole**

If for some reason you didn't pay attention in your high school Mwaneḷe classes, that probably looks like a block of illegible text, so let me break it down verse by verse with a bit of info about the words and constructions I chose.

    ta- ote -kwi ṭeŋi         ŋe e-  naka   mekeŋi
    PSV-hope-CON look.forward DS APV-be.far tomorrow
    trying to look forward, but tomorrow is too far away

The verb **ṭeŋi** so far is only used in the SVC **ote ṭeŋi** *'to look forward to'* so I'm not yet sure what (if anything!) it means outside of that.

    SS APV-VEN-approach CMP-mix =LNK loneliness and dullness follow=1
    but I'm getting used to the fact that loneliness and dullness follow us

I changed this a bit from the original ""life is the sum of loneliness and dullness"" to something like ""loneliness and dullness are combined, following us"" because it fit the rhythm better. There are two words that have meanings like dullness. I chose **mikwaḍa** which has a connotation of being regular and uninteresting, as opposed to **gwelaḍa** which can mean dullness, but can also refer to the state of being safe or comfortable because of its regularity. I wanted the more negative one, cause ya know, sadboi hours.

    di    ḷefa xoḍa       ta- xeḷe
    1.COP skin melancholy PSV-skin
    I'm a sad husk

This means you're what's left over after something's been hulled, husked, or skinned. The reflexive form of **xeḷe** can also mean *'to regret'* which works well here.

    e-  meŋi=de kese owu   da
    APV-walk=1  with river fresh
    we walk along the Owu Da

If the Tamsui river were in Mwane country it'd be called **Owu Da** *'freshwater river'* as a calque of Danshuihe.

    watch.over evening yell-CON DS R/R-close tranquilly
    surveying the night, I want to scream but everything's quiet

**Kwelam** is specifically the time after the sun's gone down but before you've gone to sleep. **Ḷenu** is an idiom for *'to be quiet'* so this line is...*'it was quietly quiet'*

    jeji    =lo jeteteŋ   =de

The word **jeteteŋ** has the connotation of things repeated ad infinitum, again choosing the more bleak of a set of synonyms. (Remember those from Lexember?)

    e-  dol -lo  megwa
    PSV-fall-NFI sun
    the sun is falling

Not setting like it does every night, but falling out of the sky, like it might hit you.

    olu  ṭem  kanan

Lungs are where relaxation lives, and if you *'need lungs'* in Mwane, it's because you're freaking out.

    e-  ṭiḷe     =ole
    APV-move.west=all
    everything moving backwards

Moving east is forwards and moving west is backwards. I *think* this is cause Mwane people live at a latitude where weather patterns tend to move to the east, but I don't entirely remember. I think this was from a few Lexembers ago.

Enjoy the song! If you're happy, listen to it to make yourself sad. If you're sad, listen to it to make yourself a little less sad. The vibes from the guitar in the first half (?) definitely make me a little less sad.

1526,0,"Anotzi, also called Feshi (from the word /feˈʃi/, meaning ""tongue) is a conlang that I started work on about a month ago, and is probably one of the most developed conlangs I've made so far. It has an extensive list of noun cases that are used in conjunction with multiple different mutated forms which change the final sound of the word.

There are three different mutated forms and one base form, which have unique names within Anotzi culture, and which are grouped based on the final sound of the root word:

|\-Vn|\-Vi|\-Vlle\*|\-Vnde|

(V represents the final vowel of the word that comes before the coda /n/.)

(\*It is worth noting that, due to the rather complicated way in which the mutated forms evolved, the Dusk form of N-Stem words is the only natural occurrence of geminate /l/ within the Anotzi language, as well as geminates in general.)

The different cases are a series of particles which are used in conjunction with the declined form.

# Volitional and Optative Moods

The volitional and optative moods are similar in many ways, but have distinct roles. The optative mood is used to talk about events the **subject** of the verb wishes, wants, or desires. The point of view is always on the subject, so to speak. On the other hand, the volitional mood is used to talk about events the **speaker** wants to happen. The point of view is always on the speaker, even if they aren't the subject of the sentence. 

Optative marker: *eyá(h)-*                                                                                                                                                Volitional marker: *d(o)-*

In the 1st person, the optative mood shows that the speaker wants, wishes, or desires the action to occur, while using the volitional mood shows that the speaker intends to do that action in the future, or that the speaker thinks it would be wise to do the action. Often, the optative mood is used with actions that are out of the speaker's control, while the volitional mood is used with actions the speaker is able to control.

*he****do****nepachiw nendawen*  ""I'm **going** **to** pass the test"", because the speaker plans to study hard etc.

*h****eyá****nepachiw nendawen*  ""I **hope** I pass the test""

In the 2nd and 3rd persons, the optative mood is used to show that the subject desires the action to occur, while the volitional mood is used to give advice, opinion, or show that the speaker desires the action to occur.

***eyá****yóm*  ""He wants to sleep"" 

***do****yóm*  ""He should sleep"" or ""I want him to sleep""

Lastly, the volitional mood can be used to suggest a course of action, akin to ""lets X"".

1541,0,"This is about a clitic in my conlang Patches that expresses what I'll call the iamitive. This is similar in some respects to a perfect, and also to the phasal aspect expressed by (for example) English ""already,"" but it is distinct from both. (The name ""iamitive"" comes from the Latin **iam** '_already_.')

The category of iamitives was posited by Bruno Olson in his Masters thesis [Iamitives: Perfects in Southeast Asia and beyond](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:633203/FULLTEXT01.pdf). I learned of it from Christian Döhler's grammar of [Komnzo](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/212) (recommeded), though most of my instincts for how it works come from Mandarin's sentence-final _le_ 了. Vander Klok and Matthewson ([Distinguishing _already_ from perfect aspect](https://linguistics.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/02/vanderklok_matthewson-proofread1.pdf)) have an argument that there's no such thing as an iamitive; obviously they can't be refuted by a conlang, but I've taken pains to show why the Patches iamitive isn't really a perfect or an '_already_.'

The core semantics of the Patches iamitive involves a contrast between the situation being reported and some other contextually salient situation---which (among other possibilities) might be a past situation, an expected situation, or a situation known to obtain. This makes the iamitive more of a discourse particle than a marker specifically of aspect; and that's where it differs most straightforwardly from perfects and from '_already_.'

# =mish

The Patches iamitive is expressed with a second-position clitic, which today is **=mish**. (Yesterday it was **=mes**; it's early days for this language, and such things are still in flux.)

As a second position clitic, it very often directly follows the verb (Patches is verb-initial). So it can look like this:
    
    (1) p'áchmi =mish     
        IAM     =dance:1pB
        ""We're dancing (now)""

It will occur before the lexical verb when it can find a host there:
    
    (2) ha'  =mish  p'áchmi   
        PRES =IAM   dance:1p.B
        ""We're dancing (now)""

A tricky point is that under some circumstances, **=mish** (and other second-position clitics) will occur in a position that might seems to be mid-word. For the purposes of this post, the most important such cases involve full reduplication:
    
    (3) gemme=mish gemmew
        REDUP =mish  gemmew   
        ADJZR =IAM   cold:1s.B
        ""I'm (too) cold (now)""

The rule here is that second position clitics like **=mish** will sometimes occur after the first _foot_ rather than after the first _word_; but the conditions under which that happens, and the conditions under which a word will comprise more than one foot, are too complex to go into them here.

# 'Change of state'

One core use that's supposed to distinguish iamitives from perfects is to express changes of state. (3), above, was an example: it tells you not just that I am cold, but also that previously I was not cold. You can't do that with just a perfect: ""I have been cold"" does not express a change, for that you need ""I have become cold.""

Now, you could suppose that a sentence like (3) involves a covert aspect shift: **gemme gemme** normally means '_be cold_,' but here it means '_become cold_.' That would allow you to interpret **=mish** as a sort of perfect.

But that's unlikely to be right here, because Patches shows no sign of allowing covert aspect shifts of the required sort. Quite the contrary, overt inchoative and inceptive derivations are very common. For example, to say the equivalent of ""the soldiers arrived and we ran,"" you'd need a specifically inceptive form of **tza'** '_run_'; and the normal way to say that you want to be cold requires an inceptive (together with a modal suffix). So if this construction required inchoative semantics, it's strange that Patches doesn't require an overtly inchoative form.

The easier hypothesis is that what's relevant here is not a change---a kind of event---but simply a contrast between two situations, the one that obtains now (or at the topic time, if that's been shifted) and a salient prior situation. Of course you can infer that a change has taken place; but what I'm saying is that the sentence does not directly encode that change.

Here's another example:
    
    (4) qwayal =ya  =mish  fachám
        mayor  =ASS =IAM   Facham
        ""Facham is mayor (now)""

(ASS is for _assertion_, though **=ya** is often obligatory with noun predicates.)

All that said, when the predicate _does_ overtly describe an event, the resulting semantics are quite similar to what you get with an English perfect:
    
    (5) ixkás  =mish =may   fachám
        arrive =IAM  =PAST  Facham
        ""Facham has arrived""

This describes a past event and says that the state resulting from that event continues to obtain at the topic time: it's not just that Facham arrived, in addition she's still here. I'm claiming, though, that in the Patches sentence the issue isn't the present relevance of a past event, but the contrast between the ensuing, and ongoing, situation, and some salient past situation.

Indeed, many verbs that encode changes of state have stative (resultative) derivations; for example, **chá** '_to open_' becomes **chaah** '_to be open_.' When you use such a verb with **=mish**, the stative form is preferred:
    
    (6) 
        
        a. ?chá  =mish =may   ne   nchá
            open =IAM  =PAST  DET  door
            Intended: ""The door has opened""
        
        b. chaah     =mish  ne   nchá
           open:STAT =IAM   DET  door
           ""The door is open (now)""

(As we'll see, (6a) is fine with other meanings.)

Thus, far from requiring an eventive interpretation of a stative predicate, **=mish** is most natural with a stative predicate, when one is available. This is not an absolute rule. (6a) is not impossible with the intended meaning. And though **kás** '_arrive_' does not have a stative derivation, you could in principle substitute **yeen** '_(be) here_,' but **kás** '_arrive_' still occurs freely with **=mish**. Still, the clear preference is exactly the opposite of what we'd expect if this were some sort of perfect.

Another point. I've given two examples with eventive predicates, (5) and (6a), and both have included the past tense marker **=may**. I haven't sorted out when if ever it's obligatory to mark past tense overtly, so it's possible you could omit it in these examples. But it's certainly possible, and that has a relevant implication: iamitive **=mish** does not itself encode pastness. That's further support for the idea that what these sentences report is not a still-relevant past event, but rather a current situation.

# New knowledge

The contrast need not be with a situation that actually obtained, a contrast with prior knowledge is enough.

Here's an example:
    
    (7) akwráál  =ya  =mish  fachám
        sorceror =ASS =IAM   Facham
        ""Facham is a sorceror (wtf)""

This probably doesn't involve a change of state: if Facham is a sorceror now, she probably was before. What's changed is the speaker or hearer's knowledge of this.

It's enough if it's only the hearer's knowledge that's changing: you can use **=mish** to report news to others even if it's not news to you. Maybe the right thing to say here is that the contrast is with the common ground, the body of assumptions shared by both speaker and hearer, and the iamitive can amount to a request that the common ground be updated with a new fact.

This use of **=mish** normally has a mirative or counter-expectation sense: the fact being reported is not just new, but also somewhat surprising. (Hence the ""wtf"" in the glosses.) So I'll call this the mirative use, as opposed to the change-of-state use discussed earlier.

With a mirative sense, **=mish** occurs freely with eventive predicates (contrast (6a)):
    
    (8) chá  =mish =may   ne   nchá
        open =IAM  =PAST  DET  door
        ""The door opened (wtf)""

On the intended interpretation, this sentence, unlike (6a), does not imply that the door is still open.

When the reference is to a past event, specific temporal modifiers are possible:
    
    (9) ixkási      =mish =may   may  du'che    
        arrive:3p.B =IAM  =PAST  ago  three_days
        ""They arrived three days ago (wtf)""

**=mish** is common at the moment of realisation, in which case it is often accompanied by the indirect evidential particle **cha**:
    
    (10) yeen =cha =mish =may   kay   jesh
         here =IND =IAM  =PAST  also  who 
         ""Somebody was here!""

This corresponds roughly to the evidential use of perfects that you get in some languages; but note that the statement's evidential status must be encoded separately.

Maybe these uses of **=mish** should be able to cooccur with a question particle, I haven't made up my mind about that.

# Scope

As mentioned earlier, **=mish** is one of a family of clitics that occur in second position. Other such clitics include past tense **=mai**, indirect evidential **=cha**, and the assertian particle **=ya'**, all of which we've seen, and fifteen or so others that we have not. When more than one such clitic occurs in the same clause, they occur in a set order, and insofar as this can be determined, clitics that occur earlier take scope over those that occur later.

For example, there are clitics that mark both past and future tenses. When both occur, it's always the past tense marker that comes first; and the resulting meaning is always future-in-the-past, never past-in-the-future. And clausal negation both precedes and takes scope over both tense markers.

When **=mish** occurs with the tense clitics or with negation, it always precedes them, and takes scope over them. Take this sentence, for which I assume a change-of-state interpretation:
    
    (11) chaah =mish =hikw  ne   nchá
         open  =IAM  =NEG   DET  door
         ""The door is not open (now)""

This says that the current state is one in which the door is not open, and that this contrasts with a prior state in which it was open. That's too say, **=mish** is taking scope over negation.

Here's a mirative example with both tense and negation:
    
    (12) chá  =mish =hikw =mokw      ne   nchá
         open =IAM  =NEG  =PAST:NEG  DET  door
         ""The door didn't open (wtf)""

This presents it as a surprising fact that the door didn't open: **=mish** is taking scope over both negation and tense.

**=mish** does follow evidential clitics, though it does not seem to interact with them scopally. Here's another moment-of-realisation example:
    
    (13) gwo''ostopsu=cha=mish=kwo
         gwo'  -'    -stap -s  -w    =cha =mish =kwo 
         steal -CMPL -bone -TR -1s.B =IND =IAM  =2s.A
         ""You stole my money! (wtf)""

This indicates that I have reason to believe that you stole my money, and that it's surprising that you stole my money, but it doesn't indicate either that I have reason to believe that it's surprising that you stole my money or that it's surprising that I have reason to believe that you stole my money; that's what I meant when I said that **=mish** and the evidential don't interact scopally. I take this to result from the fact that the contrast implied by **=mish** is not part of the at-issue content of the statement, and thus does not fall within the scope of higher operators.

One reason these facts about scope are noteworthy is that they distinguish **=mish** both from perfects and from adverbs meaning '_already_.' Perfects consistently scope under tense, when both are present, which is what allows perfects to express relative tense, past-in-the-past and past-in-the-future. You can't do that with **=mish** (and have no reason to want to, since it has relative rather than absolute tense). '_already_' is a bit more flexible, but I daresay words meaning '_already_' always can scope under tense and negation; indeed, they very frequently have negative-polarity duals like English ""yet"" (more on this shortly).

# Counterfactuals

Many languages (including English) use a sort of fake past tense to encode counterfactual semantics. In Patches, that's done with **=mish**. Here's how it can look:
    
    (14) hós  foon =mish  wáyya  jesh  tetze  akwráál  =ya   fachám
         if   know =IAM   all    who   thus   sorceror =ASS  Facham
             qwayalya  =mish =hikw =t'an  aba 
             mayor:INC =IAM  =NEG  =MOD   then
         ""If everybody knew Facham is a sorceror, then she would not be mayor""

I'm not ready to treat this issue in any detail, but I'll note that **=mish** is presumably suitable because of the implied contrast between the situation being described and the way things actually are.

# Experiential and universal perfects

The experiential perfect can be expressed with the regular past tense:
    
    (15) kwo''ow       =may   chéchetz
         eat:CMPL:1s.B =PAST  bat     
         ""I have eaten bat""

When you've just done something for the first time, **=mish** can be added:
    
    (16) kwo''ow       =mish =may   chéchetz
         eat:CMPL:1s.B =IAM  =PAST  bat     
         ""(Now) I've eaten bat""

But the function of **=mish** here is to indicate that this is a recent experience, and thus it's only newly the case that the speaker has eaten bat. That's to say, **=mish** doesn't encode the experiential perfect here, but rather applies to a proposition that already has the semantics of an experiential perfect.

The iamitive is used with universal perfects only when an explicit time span is given:
    
    (17) dardaru  =mish  ne   yeen  walárn  
         sit:1s.B =IAM   DET  here  one_bowl
         ""I've been sitting here for one bowl""

(A bowl is maybe four hours; the unit is derived from water clocks.)

The iamitive is presumably there because the time span is constantly increasing, so any situation that involves an overt timespan is going to count as saliently new.

In the absence of an overt timespan, universal perfects don't get special encoding, you'd just use a regular imperfective.

The point is that the use of the iamitive with experiential and universal perfects is entirely predictable from what I take to be its core sense: contrasting the described situation with some other, likely past, situation. It's not evidence that the iamitive is really a perfect.

# '_already_'

At the same time, **=mish** contrasts sharply with words meaning '_already_.' I've already mentioned the scope facts, here are a couple of other issues.

'_already_' implies that the described event was expected: it can't be the case that someone already arrived if they weren't expected to arrive. This is exactly the opposite of the mirative uses of **=mish** described above. Admittedly some (though not all) '_already_' adverbs imply that the described event took place earlier than expected; but that hardly casts light on mirative uses of **=mish**, which have nothing in particular to do with time.

'_already_' adverbs also frequently occur in a family of related phasal adverbs, often including negative polarity items like English ""yet."" There's nothing similar with **=mish**. There's no syntactically similar word meaning something like '_still_,' for example, and of course there's no negative polarity variant, since **=mish** is never in the scope of negation. (By contrast, the past tense clitic **=may** does have a negative variant, **=mokw**.)

I actually haven't decided yet whether Patches has an adverb that more nearly matches ""already."" Probably it does, and probably it's used when you want to indicated that something happened earlier than expected. If so, that will obviously bolster the case that **=mish** doesn't simply mean '_already_.'

# Coda

Patches is a new language, and a lot is still up in the air. But so far I'm liking this iamitive, and the ways it's playing with other bits of Patches grammar. If you've made it this far, I hope you agree :)",The Patches iamitive,"This is about a clitic in my conlang Patches that expresses what I'll call the iamitive. This is similar in some respects to a perfect, and also to the phasal aspect expressed by (for example) English ""already,"" but it is distinct from both. (The name ""iamitive"" comes from the Latin **iam** '_already_.')

The category of iamitives was posited by Bruno Olson in his Masters thesis [Iamitives: Perfects in Southeast Asia and beyond](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:633203/FULLTEXT01.pdf). I learned of it from Christian Döhler's grammar of [Komnzo](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/212) (recommeded), though most of my instincts for how it works come from Mandarin's sentence-final _le_ 了. Vander Klok and Matthewson ([Distinguishing _already_ from perfect aspect](https://linguistics.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/02/vanderklok_matthewson-proofread1.pdf)) have an argument that there's no such thing as an iamitive; obviously they can't be refuted by a conlang, but I've taken pains to show why the Patches iamitive isn't really a perfect or an '_already_.'

The core semantics of the Patches iamitive involves a contrast between the situation being reported and some other contextually salient situation---which (among other possibilities) might be a past situation, an expected situation, or a situation known to obtain. This makes the iamitive more of a discourse particle than a marker specifically of aspect; and that's where it differs most straightforwardly from perfects and from '_already_.'

# =mish

The Patches iamitive is expressed with a second-position clitic, which today is **=mish**. (Yesterday it was **=mes**; it's early days for this language, and such things are still in flux.)

As a second position clitic, it very often directly follows the verb (Patches is verb-initial). So it can look like this:
    
    (1) p'áchmi =mish     
        IAM     =dance:1pB
        ""We're dancing (now)""

It will occur before the lexical verb when it can find a host there:
    
    (2) ha'  =mish  p'áchmi   
        PRES =IAM   dance:1p.B
        ""We're dancing (now)""

A tricky point is that under some circumstances, **=mish** (and other second-position clitics) will occur in a position that might seems to be mid-word. For the purposes of this post, the most important such cases involve full reduplication:
    
    (3) gemme=mish gemmew
        REDUP =mish  gemmew   
        ADJZR =IAM   cold:1s.B
        ""I'm (too) cold (now)""

The rule here is that second position clitics like **=mish** will sometimes occur after the first _foot_ rather than after the first _word_; but the conditions under which that happens, and the conditions under which a word will comprise more than one foot, are too complex to go into them here.

# 'Change of state'

One core use that's supposed to distinguish iamitives from perfects is to express changes of state. (3), above, was an example: it tells you not just that I am cold, but also that previously I was not cold. You can't do that with just a perfect: ""I have been cold"" does not express a change, for that you need ""I have become cold.""

Now, you could suppose that a sentence like (3) involves a covert aspect shift: **gemme gemme** normally means '_be cold_,' but here it means '_become cold_.' That would allow you to interpret **=mish** as a sort of perfect.

But that's unlikely to be right here, because Patches shows no sign of allowing covert aspect shifts of the required sort. Quite the contrary, overt inchoative and inceptive derivations are very common. For example, to say the equivalent of ""the soldiers arrived and we ran,"" you'd need a specifically inceptive form of **tza'** '_run_'; and the normal way to say that you want to be cold requires an inceptive (together with a modal suffix). So if this construction required inchoative semantics, it's strange that Patches doesn't require an overtly inchoative form.

The easier hypothesis is that what's relevant here is not a change---a kind of event---but simply a contrast between two situations, the one that obtains now (or at the topic time, if that's been shifted) and a salient prior situation. Of course you can infer that a change has taken place; but what I'm saying is that the sentence does not directly encode that change.

Here's another example:
    
    (4) qwayal =ya  =mish  fachám
        mayor  =ASS =IAM   Facham
        ""Facham is mayor (now)""

(ASS is for _assertion_, though **=ya** is often obligatory with noun predicates.)

All that said, when the predicate _does_ overtly describe an event, the resulting semantics are quite similar to what you get with an English perfect:
    
    (5) ixkás  =mish =may   fachám
        arrive =IAM  =PAST  Facham
        ""Facham has arrived""

This describes a past event and says that the state resulting from that event continues to obtain at the topic time: it's not just that Facham arrived, in addition she's still here. I'm claiming, though, that in the Patches sentence the issue isn't the present relevance of a past event, but the contrast between the ensuing, and ongoing, situation, and some salient past situation.

Indeed, many verbs that encode changes of state have stative (resultative) derivations; for example, **chá** '_to open_' becomes **chaah** '_to be open_.' When you use such a verb with **=mish**, the stative form is preferred:
    
    (6) 
        
        a. ?chá  =mish =may   ne   nchá
            open =IAM  =PAST  DET  door
            Intended: ""The door has opened""
        
        b. chaah     =mish  ne   nchá
           open:STAT =IAM   DET  door
           ""The door is open (now)""

(As we'll see, (6a) is fine with other meanings.)

Thus, far from requiring an eventive interpretation of a stative predicate, **=mish** is most natural with a stative predicate, when one is available. This is not an absolute rule. (6a) is not impossible with the intended meaning. And though **kás** '_arrive_' does not have a stative derivation, you could in principle substitute **yeen** '_(be) here_,' but **kás** '_arrive_' still occurs freely with **=mish**. Still, the clear preference is exactly the opposite of what we'd expect if this were some sort of perfect.

Another point. I've given two examples with eventive predicates, (5) and (6a), and both have included the past tense marker **=may**. I haven't sorted out when if ever it's obligatory to mark past tense overtly, so it's possible you could omit it in these examples. But it's certainly possible, and that has a relevant implication: iamitive **=mish** does not itself encode pastness. That's further support for the idea that what these sentences report is not a still-relevant past event, but rather a current situation.

# New knowledge

The contrast need not be with a situation that actually obtained, a contrast with prior knowledge is enough.

Here's an example:
    
    (7) akwráál  =ya  =mish  fachám
        sorceror =ASS =IAM   Facham
        ""Facham is a sorceror (wtf)""

This probably doesn't involve a change of state: if Facham is a sorceror now, she probably was before. What's changed is the speaker or hearer's knowledge of this.

It's enough if it's only the hearer's knowledge that's changing: you can use **=mish** to report news to others even if it's not news to you. Maybe the right thing to say here is that the contrast is with the common ground, the body of assumptions shared by both speaker and hearer, and the iamitive can amount to a request that the common ground be updated with a new fact.

This use of **=mish** normally has a mirative or counter-expectation sense: the fact being reported is not just new, but also somewhat surprising. (Hence the ""wtf"" in the glosses.) So I'll call this the mirative use, as opposed to the change-of-state use discussed earlier.

With a mirative sense, **=mish** occurs freely with eventive predicates (contrast (6a)):
    
    (8) chá  =mish =may   ne   nchá
        open =IAM  =PAST  DET  door
        ""The door opened (wtf)""

On the intended interpretation, this sentence, unlike (6a), does not imply that the door is still open.

When the reference is to a past event, specific temporal modifiers are possible:
    
    (9) ixkási      =mish =may   may  du'che    
        arrive:3p.B =IAM  =PAST  ago  three_days
        ""They arrived three days ago (wtf)""

**=mish** is common at the moment of realisation, in which case it is often accompanied by the indirect evidential particle **cha**:
    
    (10) yeen =cha =mish =may   kay   jesh
         here =IND =IAM  =PAST  also  who 
         ""Somebody was here!""

This corresponds roughly to the evidential use of perfects that you get in some languages; but note that the statement's evidential status must be encoded separately.

Maybe these uses of **=mish** should be able to cooccur with a question particle, I haven't made up my mind about that.

# Scope

As mentioned earlier, **=mish** is one of a family of clitics that occur in second position. Other such clitics include past tense **=mai**, indirect evidential **=cha**, and the assertian particle **=ya'**, all of which we've seen, and fifteen or so others that we have not. When more than one such clitic occurs in the same clause, they occur in a set order, and insofar as this can be determined, clitics that occur earlier take scope over those that occur later.

For example, there are clitics that mark both past and future tenses. When both occur, it's always the past tense marker that comes first; and the resulting meaning is always future-in-the-past, never past-in-the-future. And clausal negation both precedes and takes scope over both tense markers.

When **=mish** occurs with the tense clitics or with negation, it always precedes them, and takes scope over them. Take this sentence, for which I assume a change-of-state interpretation:
    
    (11) chaah =mish =hikw  ne   nchá
         open  =IAM  =NEG   DET  door
         ""The door is not open (now)""

This says that the current state is one in which the door is not open, and that this contrasts with a prior state in which it was open. That's too say, **=mish** is taking scope over negation.

Here's a mirative example with both tense and negation:
    
    (12) chá  =mish =hikw =mokw      ne   nchá
         open =IAM  =NEG  =PAST:NEG  DET  door
         ""The door didn't open (wtf)""

This presents it as a surprising fact that the door didn't open: **=mish** is taking scope over both negation and tense.

**=mish** does follow evidential clitics, though it does not seem to interact with them scopally. Here's another moment-of-realisation example:
    
    (13) gwo''ostopsu=cha=mish=kwo
         gwo'  -'    -stap -s  -w    =cha =mish =kwo 
         steal -CMPL -bone -TR -1s.B =IND =IAM  =2s.A
         ""You stole my money! (wtf)""

This indicates that I have reason to believe that you stole my money, and that it's surprising that you stole my money, but it doesn't indicate either that I have reason to believe that it's surprising that you stole my money or that it's surprising that I have reason to believe that you stole my money; that's what I meant when I said that **=mish** and the evidential don't interact scopally. I take this to result from the fact that the contrast implied by **=mish** is not part of the at-issue content of the statement, and thus does not fall within the scope of higher operators.

One reason these facts about scope are noteworthy is that they distinguish **=mish** both from perfects and from adverbs meaning '_already_.' Perfects consistently scope under tense, when both are present, which is what allows perfects to express relative tense, past-in-the-past and past-in-the-future. You can't do that with **=mish** (and have no reason to want to, since it has relative rather than absolute tense). '_already_' is a bit more flexible, but I daresay words meaning '_already_' always can scope under tense and negation; indeed, they very frequently have negative-polarity duals like English ""yet"" (more on this shortly).

# Counterfactuals

Many languages (including English) use a sort of fake past tense to encode counterfactual semantics. In Patches, that's done with **=mish**. Here's how it can look:
    
    (14) hós  foon =mish  wáyya  jesh  tetze  akwráál  =ya   fachám
         if   know =IAM   all    who   thus   sorceror =ASS  Facham
             qwayalya  =mish =hikw =t'an  aba 
             mayor:INC =IAM  =NEG  =MOD   then
         ""If everybody knew Facham is a sorceror, then she would not be mayor""

I'm not ready to treat this issue in any detail, but I'll note that **=mish** is presumably suitable because of the implied contrast between the situation being described and the way things actually are.

# Experiential and universal perfects

The experiential perfect can be expressed with the regular past tense:
    
    (15) kwo''ow       =may   chéchetz
         eat:CMPL:1s.B =PAST  bat     
         ""I have eaten bat""

When you've just done something for the first time, **=mish** can be added:
    
    (16) kwo''ow       =mish =may   chéchetz
         eat:CMPL:1s.B =IAM  =PAST  bat     
         ""(Now) I've eaten bat""

But the function of **=mish** here is to indicate that this is a recent experience, and thus it's only newly the case that the speaker has eaten bat. That's to say, **=mish** doesn't encode the experiential perfect here, but rather applies to a proposition that already has the semantics of an experiential perfect.

The iamitive is used with universal perfects only when an explicit time span is given:
    
    (17) dardaru  =mish  ne   yeen  walárn  
         sit:1s.B =IAM   DET  here  one_bowl
         ""I've been sitting here for one bowl""

(A bowl is maybe four hours; the unit is derived from water clocks.)

The iamitive is presumably there because the time span is constantly increasing, so any situation that involves an overt timespan is going to count as saliently new.

In the absence of an overt timespan, universal perfects don't get special encoding, you'd just use a regular imperfective.

The point is that the use of the iamitive with experiential and universal perfects is entirely predictable from what I take to be its core sense: contrasting the described situation with some other, likely past, situation. It's not evidence that the iamitive is really a perfect.

# '_already_'

At the same time, **=mish** contrasts sharply with words meaning '_already_.' I've already mentioned the scope facts, here are a couple of other issues.

'_already_' implies that the described event was expected: it can't be the case that someone already arrived if they weren't expected to arrive. This is exactly the opposite of the mirative uses of **=mish** described above. Admittedly some (though not all) '_already_' adverbs imply that the described event took place earlier than expected; but that hardly casts light on mirative uses of **=mish**, which have nothing in particular to do with time.

'_already_' adverbs also frequently occur in a family of related phasal adverbs, often including negative polarity items like English ""yet."" There's nothing similar with **=mish**.

Probably it does, and probably it's used when you want to indicated that something happened earlier than expected. If so, that will obviously bolster the case that **=mish** doesn't simply mean '_already_.'

1542,0,"Africana is a very conservative Romance language spoken in Northern Africa. Africana was my first a posteriori conlang, and was when I really started getting into conlanging. Now nearly 8 months later, I am finally ready to share Africana with you guys.  


&amp;#x200B;

# Phonology

Africana has a fairly standard phonology for a Romance language with a conservative few quirks.

&amp;#x200B;

||Labial|Alveolar|Dorsal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nasal|m|n|ɲ|
|Stop|p b|t d|k g kʷ|
|Fricative|f|s ʃ||
|Liquid||r\~ɾ l|j|
||Front|Back||
|Close|i|u||
|Close mid|e|o||
|open|a|||

As you can see, Africana lacks the palatalization of /k/ and /g/ seen in nearly all Romance languages. In addition, /v/ and /b/ have merged into a singular /b/ sound, although some dialects may lenited it /v/ between vowels.

&amp;#x200B;

# Nouns

Africana is unusual among Romance languages in that it retains many of the Latin case declensions as well as the entire Latin gender system.

The regular declension patterns look like so:

&amp;#x200B;

|M/F/N|singular|plural|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nominative|u/a/o|i/e/a|
|Vocative(now rare)|e/a/o|i/e/a|
|Accusative|/o/a/o|os/as/a|
|Genitive-Dative|/i/e/i|oro/aro/oro|

In addition, there are neutral nouns and adjectives which take the same pattern regardless of gender

&amp;#x200B;

||singular|plural|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nominative-vocative|i/e|e|
|accusative|e|e|
|Dative-genitive|i|io|

&amp;#x200B;

# Verbs

Like it's sister languages, Africana has a robust conjugation pattern for 3 main paradigms; -are verbs. -ere verbs, and -ire verbs. Since it would be exhausting to write out the full chart for any set of verbs, I will only include the present indicative conjugation for are verbs to demonstrate Africana verbs.

&amp;#x200B;

|verb used amare||
|:-|:-|
|Eo 1|am-o|
|Tu 2|am-as|
|Il Ila Ilúd 3|am-at|
|Nos 1pl|am-amu|
|Bos 2pl|am-ati|
|Ili Ile Ila 3pl|am-an|

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to inflected conjugations, Africana has many archaic periphrastic conjugations. For example, unlike most Romance languages, Africana maintains periphrasis with the word habere rather than weakening it to an enclitic. Here are a few periphrastic expressions  


&amp;#x200B;

|future ( I will love)|conditional ( I could love)|
|:-|:-|
|habeu ad amare|debeba ad amare|

&amp;#x200B;

# You made it!!

You did it!! you made it to the end! Now I can treat you to some fun facts about this language

\- Africana was inspired by the movie, ""Luca""

\-Africana has two main dialects: Standard and Egyptian

\- Speakers of Egyptian Africana have a much easier time understanding Standard Africana than the other way around.

\-Africana has borrowed significantly from Arabic, and is often a lingua franca among Africans and Middle-Easterners

\-Africana is part of an alt-history of mine where the earth is more linguistically diverse.

&amp;#x200B;

# Before you go...

  
I have a few questions to ask regarding your thoughts on Africana

\- What did you like/find interesting about Africana, why

\-what do you not like about Africana, how could I improve it

\-any over all thoughts regarding the language as a whole?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so glad I got to share this with you, and thank you for your time

1546,0,"Hi all,

I'm not a conlager myself, but a philosopher of language.  I'm curious what you all think about the feasibility of a fictional language devised by the philosopher Wilfrid Sellars which he calls ""Jumbalese.""  In this language, there are no predicates, but only singular terms.  Predication is achieved by writing singular terms in certain styles.  So, for instance, we might say that Bob is tall by writing ""Bob"" in a certain style, for instance, a font with elongated lettering.  Or, we might that Bob is bigger than Jon by writing ""Bob"" above ""Jon.""  

Obviously, this language is wildly impractical, but Sellars thought it was important that it be possible, and, indeed, that it be possible that one be able to say, in such a language, anything one can say in a natural language such as English.  Just to be clear about the rules, different fonts are permissible, different style of fonts (bold, italic, etc.) are permissible, different colors are permissible---anything that does not involve additional written words for predicates.

Has anyone attempted to construct a language that bears some sort of similarity to this one? Any thoughts on how one might go about doing so?  Any obvious limitations that would seem to preclude its possibility?  Interested to hear any thoughts that experienced conlangers have about it.","Thoughts on the possibility of Wilfrid Sellars's ""Jumbalese""?","Hi all,

However, I recently saw [the misty mountains sung in khudzul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wIShPoAWyw), and found myself thinking ""this just sounds dwarvish."" That might seem silly, given that it actually is dwarvish, but the fact that someone who has never read or heard proper dwarvish just recognizes it by ear is deeply impressive. Obviously a lot of that is just the cultural icon that is everything J.R.R. Tolkien and the deep voice that's singing it, but it got me wondering how to achieve something similar, because part of it definitely is the phonotactics.

1556,0,"Reposted because the original title was unclear. This is a post about the grammar of the conlang E’uy and not Classifiers/Cases in general.

My current iteration of E'uy grammar involves combining a classifier and case system for nouns. Most common nouns are a verb preceded by a classifier. While knowing the meaning of the verb and classifier can indicate a word meaning, each combination only has one or few set definitions. These are not the only classifiers, however they are the only ones that are necessary to speak the language and the only ones that decline. \[Let it be noted that this means that previous classifiers I've made before major updates are still grammatically usable, but not necessary to speaking E'uy\]

I would like to know if the system seems natural enough to be plausible (as in, could be developed by a human-like aliens with human-like thinking), or if there is another similar noun system that exists in a natlang I should look at. Rules I'm breaking or rules I'm following is always helpful to know. I'm also not sure I am using the terms correctly so polite correction in the comments is appreciated.

Itiria is an **agglutinative language** where many small parts fuse to form larger words, some of them coalescing and simplifying over time. Initially I was inspired by the Finnish grammar and combined it with some quirks from my own mother tongue, Tagalog (I'm not fluent in it).

This is the main intro page for Itiria, as this is getting a bit too long so I kinda have to divide it into.

Click here for the [phonology](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/sutojb/itiria_phonology_and_romanization/).

## Internal history

The Itiria are an ancient race of energy-beings who colonized the Milky Way thirty thousand years ago, seeding civilizations like Earth's together with the Nakta (Annunaki), mixing native DNA and their genes.

In current events, Itira is still the oldest, most powerful and technologically advanced civilization in the Universe, capable of sustaining life for thousands, if not tens of thousands of years; all by harnessing and siphoning energy from their environment to power themselves.

## Word order

Itiria follows an OSV word order by default. Nouns, verbs or whatever is emphasized is placed directly in front.

""Zaia is reading a **book**""

| Nārzhō      | Zaia        | ȫrixä  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| book.ACC.SG | Zaia.NOM.SG | read.L |

""Zaia told **her father** she is reading a book""

| **Āda** | **serēnā**    | täiljä | nārzhō      | Zaia        | ȫrixä  |
| ------- | ------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| father  | 3SG.L.GEN.FEM | tell.L | book.ACC.SG | Zaia.NOM.SG | read.L |

## Nouns

### Number

Number is marked through infixation, right after the first consonant. For example:

| Case       | Preposition |                       |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Dual       | both        | _-el(d)-_ / _-ul(d)-_ |
| Paucal     | some        | _-öl-_ / _-ol-_       |
| Plural     | many        | _-in-_ / _-yn-_       |
| Collective | all         | _-än-_ / _-an-_       |

### Gender

Nouns with a positive connotation are marked with the light gender, while nouns with a negative connotation are marked with the dark. Everything else is marked with shadow.

| Class                     | Description                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Light / _styndjo äidǟn_   | Spiritual, structured, celestial, supernatural |
| Shadow / _styndjo somrān_ | Natural, organic, tangible                     |
| Dark / _styndjo sǖndrān_  | Impure, corrupt, cruel, chaotic, subnatural    |

There is no way to determine gender from the nouns themselves but can be done through looking at nearby verbs and adjectives.

Nouns use these suffixes, as shown below. If there is a capital V, the short version of the last vowel of the word is used as part of the suffix.

Gender is not encoded within the nouns themselves, but rather the verbs and pronouns are.

- _somra_ - shadow
- _renātā solomrān_ - harbinger of the shadows
- _Zaiana, miran_ - I know, Zaia
- _jōrmyn sēüla äidälte_ - ceased from being the light (again)
- _solomrā syandara_ - some shadows flowing

| Case                  | Preposition    | Front suffix | Back suffix |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Genitive/Possessive   | of, 's         | _-Vn_        | _-Vn_       |
| Vocative              | _person_       | _-nä_        | _-na_       |
| Accusative            | _object_       | _-Vː_        | _-Vː_       |
| Dative                | to, for        | _-re_        | _-ro_       |
| Instrumental          | with, using    | _-Vs_        | _-Vs_       |
| Comitative            | together with  | _-tä_        | _-ta_       |
| Abessive              | without        | _-te_        | _-to_       |
| Locative              | in, on, at, by | _-le_        | _-lo_       |
| Reflexive (pronouns)  | -self          | _-lä_        | _-la_       |
| Possessive (pronouns) | mine, yours    | _-rin_       | _-ryn_      |

There are also nine locative suffixes for nouns (where V is the last vowel of the root it modifies). These are not considered separate noun cases, but derivatives of the locative case _-lV_.

| System | Entering | Residing | Exiting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inner | _-nnV_ 'into' (illative) | _-rnV_ 'in' (inessive) | _-lnV_ 'out from' (elative) |
| Outer | _-nzV_ 'onto' (allative) | _-rzV_ 'on' (adessive) | _-lzV_ 'away from' (ablative) |
| State | _-ndV_ 'becoming' (translative) | _-rdV_ 'as' (essive) | _-ldV_ 'from being as' (exessive) |

Each gender can have an optional masculine or feminine suffix, which is basically _ō/ȫ_ and _ā/ǟ_ respectively attached after the case suffix. This subclass is therefore not compulsory, but required for honorifics.

## Pronouns

### Three degrees of respect

The inferior, equal and superior trichotomy works with respect to social status, age/generation, relationship distance and caste, all depending on context. Or if the speaker wants to address themself in a rather humble or prideful way.

| Context | Equal      | Inferior  | Superior           |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Family  | Siblings   | Children  | Parents            |
| School  | Friends    | Students  | Mentors            |
| Work    | Colleagues | Employees | Employers, leaders |
| Caste   | Proles     | Slaves    | Royals and elite   |
| Species | Foreigners | Animals   | Deities            |

### Basic Pronouns

These pronouns have irregular forms and hence they are not conjugated for number.

| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------- |

| 1PAU exclusive     | I and company    | _eilä_  |
| 1PL/COLL inclusive | us               | _nīr_   |
| 1PL/COLL exclusive | they and I       | _nār_   |
| 2PL/COLL general   | you all          | _jǖlir_ |
| 2PL/COLL exclusive | they and you     | _mīzar_ |
| 3PL/COLL general   | they             | _sar_   |
| General            | one              | _ilä_   |
| General paucal     | some, others     | _sol_   |
| General collective | all              | _kol_   |

### Demonstratives

Demonstratives are conjugated like regular nouns. Just like Tagalog, there are two different forms of here and there, based on the object is near the speaker, the addressee, either or neither.

""Oh, what's this?""

| O   | sȳndõ | isō  | äire? |

Today's word is **vermilion**, n. - *the brilliant, vibrant, scarlet-red pigment composed of mercury(II) sulfide, which naturally occurs in the form of the mineral cinnabar.*

Via Old French *vermeil*, from Latin *vermiculus* ""little worm"", diminutive of *vermis* ""worm"", from PIE \**wr̥mis* ""worm"", either from the 0-grade of stem \**wer-* ""to turn; to bend"" (though some reconstruct this root as \**wert-* instead), or a mutation of the synonymous \**kʷŕ̥mis*.

Although as an inorganic mineral pigment vermilion actually has nothing to do with worms, it acquired its name because of its scarlet color, and up to that point the color scarlet was associated with kermes or carmine pigment (both of which, along with ""crimson"", ultimately trace back to the same root \**kʷŕ̥mis* ""worm""), which were extracted from the bodies of certain insects.

TLDR below 

So I'm an accent and dialect coach based in the UK. I'm still studying for my MFA in Voice and am currently in my final year which is set aside for independent research. 

My area I want to specialise in is dialect design for constructed languages and races. Currently, I am trying to determine (for my dissertation due in 3 months) whether it is possible to invent a dialect for a fictional race based purely on the given circumstances of the material this particular race lives. I am in the process of creating a podcast called ""Dungeons and Dialects"" where I'll see if it's possible to create an organic accent from scratch rather than using one that already exists in the world (e.g. Let's just make them sound like X.) I want to explore how anatomy, geography or even education and politics effect accent and voice! I hope this is making sense...

Anywho - I've had some wonderful interviews with leading accent and dialect specialists and linguists who seem to be intrigued in the idea! But we've come to the conclusion that, of course, an accent cannot made without first working out their original language! Now, I'm not a linguist at all, but I have become very interested in the wonderful world of conlangs (David J. Peterson's ""The Art of Language Invention"" being the jumping off point for me.) Intrigue and interest does not replace the skill of a linguist unfortunately! And so, I'm wondering if anyone here would be interested in creating a conlang (or has one already created) that I can collaborate with for this research? It's a big ask, but I genuinely think that it'll make a difference to TV/Movie/Video Game performances, improving authenticity and accuracy. 

If you fancy it, give me a shout! And feel free to put some comments below.

This language is spoken by people living in a parallel universe around 50 years from now, where a bunch of tech companies have now merged in a massive entity, and have declared a communist state across a large swath of the western United States. 

Huuma (\*working title) is a weird language: it's based on biconsonantal roots, has split ergativity and is written in a modified version of Devanagari for purely astethic purposes.

The translation is pretty loose, especially the last two lines

This language is spoken by people living in a parallel universe around 50 years from now, where a bunch of tech companies have now merged in a massive entity, and have declared a communist state across a large swath of the western United States. 

Huuma (\*working title) is a weird language: it's based on biconsonantal roots, has split ergativity and is written in a modified version of Devanagari for purely astethic purposes.

The translation is pretty loose, especially the last two lines

1593,0,"Hello r/conlangs,  
whilst working on my conlang recently, I've started to question whether I like to sound of it more and more.  


When I started almost half a year ago I wasn't exactly sure if I knew what sound I was going for. I had some general guidelines, but no laid-out foundation for what it's exactly supposed to be.  
Seeing as I'm still in the pretty early stages of the language, *as I simply like to take my time to make sure everything is as I want*, I wanted to look back at the foundation and give it a little make-over.

One of my ideas so far has been;

&gt;Writing-out a long text of gibberish (*as I don't have enough words &amp; grammar to make full real sentences yet*), include as many of my currently available words as possible, and simply play around with certain sounds, sound combinations and so on 'till I eventually stumble upon something closely resembling my wishes.

I'm not entirely sure if this would work exactly like I want to though.

The Telephone Game will be posted every Monday and Friday, hopefully. 

### Rules

1) Post a word in your language, with IPA and a definition.

Note: try to show your word inflected, as it would appear in a typical sentence. This can be the source of many interesting borrowings in natlangs (like how so many Arabic words were borrowed with the definite article fossilized onto it! algebra, alcohol, etc.)

2) Respond to a post by adapting the word to your language's phonology, and consider shifting the meaning of the word a bit!

3) Sometimes, you may see an interesting phrase or construction in a language. Instead of adopting the word as a loan word, you are welcome to **calque** the phrase -- for example, taking *skyscraper* by using your language's native words for *sky* and *scraper*. If you do this, please label the post at the start as **Calque** so people don't get confused about your path of adopting/loaning.

1614,0,"This post, as the title suggests, will cover terms used to address one another in Proto-Avian (I used to go around calling it Ancient Avian, but I think Proto-Avian is a better term).

**Relational Terms**

Father: da

Mother: nâ

Son: zhe

Daughter: ngè

Brother: shú

* Big Brother: pápü
* Little Brother: lîju

Sister: qû

* Big Sister: páhtî
* Little Sister: lînâ

Husband: ɬé

Wife: tè

**Lateral Terms**

These are terms used to describe individuals who cannot be described using the relational terms listed above. So nâtɬî refers not only to your parent's sister but also to a female relative who is within your parents' generation.

Uncle: datɬü

Aunt: nâtɬî

Nephew: zhetɬü

Niece: ngètɬî

Cousin (male): shútɬü

Cousin (female): qûtɬlî

**Family Heads**

Family heads are referred to as Sister, Mother, or Grandparent, depending on their age and their relation to other family members. Brother and Father may be used if the family head happens to be male (only the case if there are no adult women in the family unit).

Sister/Brother

* less than a generation older than the rest of the family

Mother/Father

* having children a generation younger within their care
* a generation older than the youngest member of the family

Grandparent (tsââ)

* having children two or more generations younger within their care
* two or more generations older than the youngest member of the family

**When to Use Which Term?**

Here's a series of questions that can be used to determine which terms to use for which individuals. An individual's relatedness to you is determined by how many relational terms are needed to describe their relation to you. Two individuals are considered unrelated if they need more than four terms to describe each other.

Can they be described using one relational term?

* If yes, use relational terms.

Are they the head of a family unit?

* If yes, ask: Are they related to you?
   * If yes, use relational, lateral, or family head terms.
   * If no, ask: Are they part of *your* family unit?
      * If yes, use lateral or family head terms.
      * If no, use family head terms.
* If no, ask: Are they related to you?
   * If yes, use relational or lateral terms.
   * If no, ask: Are they part of *your* family unit?
      * If yes, use lateral terms.
      * If no, don't use any of these terms. Instead, refer to them by name.

If you want to refer to a specific person (say, you are with two ""uncles"" and you want to address one of them in particular), you use the appropriate term and follow it up with their name.

Cultural note: Family units usually consist of 4-5 individuals, usually related to each other by blood or by marriage but not always. They are usually led by the eldest woman, though if all individuals are roughly the same age, there may be less of a hierarchy among members.

**1st, 2nd, 3rd Person**

&amp;#x200B;

||Relational|Lateral|Family Head|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1st Person|I am \_\_\_'s mother's mother.||I am the Mother of this family.|
|2nd Person|Brother, let's go hunting together.|Nephew, we need to talk.||
|3rd Person|\_\_\_'s sister's son just got married!|Your aunt is sick.|That Grandparent is very wise and kind.|

\*Let's say, for example, that there is a particular family unit composed of a woman, her father's sister, and her two children\*\*. In such a family unit, the woman's father's sister would be the family head. The children would refer the family head as ""Mother's Father's Sister"" or ""Grandparent,"" but the woman could refer to her as ""Father's Sister,"" ""Aunt,"" or ""Grandparent.""

\*\*This is not common. One possible reason for this setup is that both women's husbands died.

**Example**

This is an excerpt from my yet-to-be-translated fable, titled the ""Arrogant Boy.""

""So the woman told her brother, who told his wife, who told her sister, who was the young hunter’s mother.""

The woman in question is the boy's mother's (1) sister's (2) husband's (3) sister (4), so people consider the two to be related to each other. However, she is not part of the boy's family unit (presumably consisting of himself, his parents, and his siblings).

Answering the questions listed above, she can be referred to using relational terms (the boy's mother's sister's husband's sister) or lateral terms (aunt). If she is a family head, she may be referred to as the Sister/Mother/Grandparent of her family.",Terms For Addressing Relatives in Proto-Avian,"This post, as the title suggests, will cover terms used to address one another in Proto-Avian (I used to go around calling it Ancient Avian, but I think Proto-Avian is a better term).

\*Let's say, for example, that there is a particular family unit composed of a woman, her father's sister, and her two children\*\*. In such a family unit, the woman's father's sister would be the family head. The children would refer the family head as ""Mother's Father's Sister"" or ""Grandparent,"" but the woman could refer to her as ""Father's Sister,"" ""Aunt,"" or ""Grandparent.""

\*\*This is not common. One possible reason for this setup is that both women's husbands died.

**Example**

This is an excerpt from my yet-to-be-translated fable, titled the ""Arrogant Boy.""

""So the woman told her brother, who told his wife, who told her sister, who was the young hunter’s mother.""

The woman in question is the boy's mother's (1) sister's (2) husband's (3) sister (4), so people consider the two to be related to each other. However, she is not part of the boy's family unit (presumably consisting of himself, his parents, and his siblings).

Answering the questions listed above, she can be referred to using relational terms (the boy's mother's sister's husband's sister) or lateral terms (aunt). If she is a family head, she may be referred to as the Sister/Mother/Grandparent of her family.Terms For Addressing Relatives in Proto-Avian",thi post titl suggest cover term use address one anoth proto avian i use go around call ancient avian i think proto avian better term relat term father da mother n son zhe daughter ng brother sh big brother p p littl brother l ju sister q big sister p ht littl sister l n husband wife later term these term use describ individu cannot describ use relat term list so n refer parent sister also femal rel within parent gener uncl dat aunt n nephew zhet niec ng cousin male sh cousin femal q l famili head famili head refer sister mother grandpar depend age relat famili member brother father may use famili head happen male case adult women famili unit sister brother less gener older rest famili mother father children gener younger within care gener older youngest member famili grandpar ts children two gener younger within care two gener older youngest member famili when use which term here seri question use determin term use individu an individu related determin mani relat term need describ relat two individu consid unrel need four term describ can describ use one relat term if ye use relat term are head famili unit if ye ask are relat if ye use relat later famili head term if ask are part famili unit if ye use later famili head term if use famili head term if ask are relat if ye use relat later term if ask are part famili unit if ye use later term if use term instead refer name if want refer specif person say two uncl want address one particular use appropri term follow name cultur note famili unit usual consist individu usual relat blood marriag alway they usual led eldest woman though individu roughli age may less hierarchi among member st nd rd person amp x b relat later famili head st person i mother mother i mother famili nd person brother let go hunt togeth nephew need talk rd person sister son got marri your aunt sick that grandpar wise kind let say exampl particular famili unit compos woman father sister two children in famili unit woman father sister would famili head the children would refer famili head mother father sister grandpar woman could refer father sister aunt grandpar thi common one possibl reason setup women husband die exampl thi excerpt yet translat fabl titl arrog boy so woman told brother told wife told sister young hunter mother the woman question boy mother sister husband sister peopl consid two relat howev part boy famili unit presum consist parent sibl answer question list refer use relat term boy mother sister husband sister later term aunt if famili head may refer sister mother grandpar famili term for address rel proto avian

## [Depictive secondary predicates in crosslinguistic perspective (Schultze-Berndt &amp; Himmelmann)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/548047367153385477/944560716042620958/schultze-berndt_and_himmelmann_depictive_secondary_predicates_2004.pdf)

This week's paper was submitted by my friend u/akamchinjir and talks about so-called depictive secondary predicates, like in *George left the party angry*. In this clause, *left the party* is referred to as the ""main predicate"", while *angry* is the depictive predicate. Semantically, the main verb is often a verb of motion (*to cross*), ingestion (*to drink*) or manipulation. The depictive (or secondary) predicate usually encodes a physical or psychological state or condition (*barefoot*, *cold*). There are some further syntactic considerations regarding the distinction between depictive predicates and e.g. resultatives or predicate complements. A definition of the term ""depictive secondary predicate"" is given in section 2.8, so if you're still not sure if you understand the concept or want a more precise explanation, you can check out that section on page 19 (77). Now onto the prompts:

* Does your language have secondary predicates at all? Does it feature depictive predicates?
    * What are the semantics of secondary predicates in your language?
    * How are they marked morphologically?
    * How do they contrast to other syntactic constructions like SVCs or adverbs, if they exist?
    * What word classes do depictives belong to in your language?

See you next Saturday, and happy conlanging!",Typological Paper of the Week #47: Depictive secondary predicates in crosslinguistic perspective,"Good evening, afternoon, or morning to you, people of r/conlangs. Today's Saturday, and that means it's time for another typological paper! Once again, there will be some prompts for you to discuss in the comments.

## [Depictive secondary predicates in crosslinguistic perspective (Schultze-Berndt &amp; Himmelmann)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/548047367153385477/944560716042620958/schultze-berndt_and_himmelmann_depictive_secondary_predicates_2004.pdf)

This week's paper was submitted by my friend u/akamchinjir and talks about so-called depictive secondary predicates, like in *George left the party angry*. In this clause, *left the party* is referred to as the ""main predicate"", while *angry* is the depictive predicate. Semantically, the main verb is often a verb of motion (*to cross*), ingestion (*to drink*) or manipulation. The depictive (or secondary) predicate usually encodes a physical or psychological state or condition (*barefoot*, *cold*). There are some further syntactic considerations regarding the distinction between depictive predicates and e.g. resultatives or predicate complements. A definition of the term ""depictive secondary predicate"" is given in section 2.8, so if you're still not sure if you understand the concept or want a more precise explanation, you can check out that section on page 19 (77). Now onto the prompts:

* Does your language have secondary predicates at all? Does it feature depictive predicates?
    * What are the semantics of secondary predicates in your language?
    * How are they marked morphologically?
    * How do they contrast to other syntactic constructions like SVCs or adverbs, if they exist?
    * What word classes do depictives belong to in your language?
    

_**Remember to try to comment on other people's languages**_

Where do you come from linguistically?

(P.-S.: I struggled a lot to make a 6 options selection, where I wanted one for ""English"" and one for ""other"". I am assuming many here are Americans or English, and among the others many are Europeans. But I may be proved wrong by my poll, who knows. I am sorry to not include directly an African language family, but I am assuming you are not that numerous - but maybe that's wrong)

# Transaltion:

A triange has three fingers/peninsulas (vertex). Three peninsulas (together) are open as a circle in half.

&amp;#x200B;

How I will prove:

If we make a wall (line segment) that touchs the vertex 1, the wall is open as a half circle. The line segment must not touch the opposite line segment ""in nowhere"". We know that the vertexs 2 and 3 can (be) drawn/written vertexs between the wall and the triangle. We know by the cause (of) the law of untouching-wall. (""Theorem of the parallel lines"")

&amp;#x200B;

∴ (therefore), (we) can see that the corners 1, 2 and 3 have the same openning of the wall that is larger open as a half circle.

# phonology

developing the phonology was pretty easy. I think I really captured the hunter-gatherer society vibe here.

the consonants are as follows:

||bilabial|alveolar|velar|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|stop|b||g|
|approximant|| ɹ ||

and the vowels are:

||central|back|
|:-|:-|:-|
|close|| u|
|mid| ə ||

&amp;#x200B;

the romanization system is:

a - ə

oo- uː

b - b

g - g

r - ɹ

&amp;#x200B;

the ways the phonemes go together is pretty specific. syllables start with either ""oo"" (/uː/), ""boo"" (/buː/), ""groo"" (/gɹuː/), or ""ga"" (/gə/), and some can end in a ""g"" (/g/).

&amp;#x200B;

# lexicon

simplicity was a goal, so there are only a total 53 words in the lexicon (turns out thats all you need) and they are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

boo - /buː/ - (literally every preposition)

boog - /buːg/ - item, thing

booga - /buːgə/ - place, structure, geographic feature

boogaboog - /buːgəbuːg/  - cave, home, hole

# grammar

the grammar is super simple. it is SVO, and adjectives go before the noun. there are no suffixes or affixes, just adjectives. for example, to say ""went"", you would say ""parent time go"", or ""grooggroog  gaoog  oogaboog"" (/gɹuːggɹuːg  gəuːg  uːgəbuːg/). most words can be nouns, adjectives, and verbs depending on where you use them, and, to make a noun plural, you simply use the word ""many"" or ""gaga"" (/gəgə/) before it. this system gets out of control when you get to more intricate sentences, but if you are using oogabooga to convey complex ideas, you are doing something wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

finally, i will leave you all with the opening line of Industrial Society and its Future by Theodore Kaczynski, translated into oogabooga.

&amp;#x200B;

# Consonants

|Sibilants||s|ɕ|||
|Affricates||ts|cɕ|||
|Approximants|ʋ|ɹ̠|j|||
|Trills|ʙ|r||||
|Laterals||l|ʎ|||

Most consonants are spelled according to IPA. Exceptions are as follows.

* Consonants in parentheses are not present in the Sky Tongue alphabet. Therefore, they are romanized as spelled in the original orthography.
* ʔ is spelled with an apostrophe.
* cɕ is spelled as ch.
* ɕ is spelled as sh.
* ʋ, ɹ̠, and j are spelled as w, r, and i, respectively.
* ʙ and r are spelled as bb and rr, respectively.
* ʎ is spelled as ly.

There are two primary romanizations: transcription and transliteration. For the most part, they are the same. Here are the differences.

* Unstressed vowels following an ejective are not pronounced. This is reflected in the transcription but not in the transliteration.
* Vowel lengthening is spelled with a double vowel in the transliteration but with a macron in the transcription.
* Voiced consonants are always spelled as pronounced in the transcription, while the transliteration only does so if it is phonemic.

**Translations will have the transcription first, then transliteration (in parentheses), then IPA (in square brackets), then gloss (in a code block), then English translation, in that order.**

# Vowels

ä (spelled a)

i

ɯ (spelled w)

In Sky Script, i and j are spelled using the same letter, and so are ɯ and ʋ.

# Phonotactics

Sky Tongue is a strict (C)V language with word-final codas (and occasionally within compound words). It treats approximants and trills as vowels.

\[ʙ\] can only be preceded by \[t\], \[d\], \[t'\], \[k\], \[g\], \[k'\], \[ʔ\] \[ɹ̠\], \[j\], or itself.

\[r\] can only be preceded by \[p\], \[b\], \[p'\], \[k\], \[g\], \[k'\], \[ʔ\] \[ʋ\], \[j\], or itself.

Consonants sandwiched by \[ä\] are voiced (this is non-phonemic and therefore reflected in the transcription but not the transliteration). In contrast, if a consonant is adjacent to a long vowel or geminate consonant or is a geminate consonant itself, it can be either voiced or unvoiced (this is phonemic and therefore included in both romanizations). Likewise, word-final consonants can be voiced or unvoiced (this is phonemic as well). These are the only places where voiced consonants are permitted, excluding nasals and laterals, which are always voiced.

Palatalization occurs in sounds immediately preceding \[i\] or \[j\]. All alveolar, post-alveolar, and velar sounds except \[r\] are pronounced as their palatal counterparts.

# Pronunciation Notes

Stress always falls on the last syllable. If the word is long enough, secondary stress may be included.

'W' and 'i' are pronounced as \[ɯ\] and \[i\] respectively when stressed or sandwiched between two consonants (excluding approximants and trills). They are pronounced as \[ʋ\] and \[j\] respectively when unstressed and adjacent to at least one vowel (including approximants and trills).

Vowel loss caused some palatalized consonants to lose the vowel that indicated the palatalization. In sibilants, affricates, approximants, and laterals, this is resolved by respelling the sound as its palatal counterpart. However, in nasals, plosives, and ejectives, there is no palatal counterpart in the orthography, so spelling is unchanged.

* 'bbkali \['ʙˈkä.ʎi\] → 'bbkaly \['ʙˈkäʎ\] (fn): aunt
   * The l was pronounced as ly \[ʎ\] due to palatalization. When the following vowel was dropped, the l became respelled as ly.
* asami (azami) \[äˈzä.ɲi\] → asam (azam) \[äˈzäɲ\] (fn): feather
   * The m was pronounced as \[ɲ\] due to palatalization. When the following vowel was dropped, the m was *not* respelled. Knowing how it's pronounced is up to sheer memorization.
      * I'm trying to figure out how to spell this in the transcribed romanization. I want to avoid heteronyms in the transcription, but I'm not sure how. Like if ""asama"" were a word as well, then word-final vowel loss would produce this asama (azama) \[äˈzä.ma\] → asam (azam) \[äˈzäm\]. Same spelling/romanization, different pronunciations, different meanings. Which I understand is naturalistic, but I don't want that in the transcription.

# Orthography

*I know this isn't part of phonology but it's on the same doc as the rest of my phonology stuff so …*

Sky Script is similar to Southeast Asian scripts in that it is round and curvy, as it is designed to be written on leaves. Because the leaves typically used are long and skinny, the script is written vertically.

Key features of the orthography

* alphabetic / featural
* written vertically
* lots of curves, no vertical lines
* inspirations: Thai, Tamil

Hey guys.

I presented hujemi to you some days ago.

Hujemi is an oligosynesthetic engelang where every phoneme is associated to one glyph and one ""morpheme""/root. There are 36 root-glyphs in total, 6 being vowels with rather grammatical meaning, 18 single consonants, 12 double consonants (like KR), both coding for a scope of meaning. Words are formed by combining roots together, with one indicating the category of the ""object"" as a head initial root (an animal will start with ""zo"").

**1) How I inspired after natural languages + intuition to decide for the phonemes (and also glyphs)**

From such a standpoint, one would expect the choice of phoneme-roots to be purely arbitrary. But what I did was to inspire after phonemes and the way they sound, and what typical meaning they be associated to, among simple base vocabulary in source languages, to decide them. And I would also ""synesthetically"" associate ideas together, be it through the languages or by themselves (for instance S is associated to star and light, but also to time, because time is traditionally estimated by the star and sky, and also because getting nearer to light velocity makes time run slower).

My source languages were limited to Romance, Germanic, and Chinese (essentially Mandarin). Unfortunately I couldn't do better than that. I contacted a Sudanese friend of mine and told her my project, but I could not really make her understand how to help and indicate for phoneme-meaning associations in Arabic. It feels like sth only me (and hypothetic people that I don't know) intuition.

Anyway. This morning, I suddenly thought I might make a Sheet graph out of it, to see what are the stats in how glyph-roots trace back to source languages.

As you can understand, this works very differently from the way traditional IALs (including Toki Pona) work, in many ways. And I can't make a chart of the same nature. So what I did was considering whether the impact of a source language was decisive (2), significant (1) or unsignificant (0), for each root.

When a root was more associated to English than with Germanic in general, or French than Romance, I specified that out with a special category for both. I also made a category for ""Universal/intuitive"" (m for me and mostly mother, b for baby, k as hard...), and one for 

Making the sum and the graph, it gave this:

The Telephone Game will be posted every Monday and Friday, hopefully. 

### Rules

1) Post a word in your language, with IPA and a definition.

Note: try to show your word inflected, as it would appear in a typical sentence. This can be the source of many interesting borrowings in natlangs (like how so many Arabic words were borrowed with the definite article fossilized onto it! algebra, alcohol, etc.)

2) Respond to a post by adapting the word to your language's phonology, and consider shifting the meaning of the word a bit!

3) Sometimes, you may see an interesting phrase or construction in a language. Instead of adopting the word as a loan word, you are welcome to **calque** the phrase -- for example, taking *skyscraper* by using your language's native words for *sky* and *scraper*. If you do this, please label the post at the start as **Calque** so people don't get confused about your path of adopting/loaning.

**rasenō** /'ɾasenoː/ _adj._:

1. Etruscan
2. sophisticated, fashionable, luxurious, noble, cultured

*Etymology*: the word comes directly from the autonym _rasenna_ with the adjectival suffix -ō.

The word has the doublet **rasnalō** /'ɾasnaloː/, which comes from the syncopated form _rasna_ plus the adjectival suffix -lō, which is used to form demonyms. This last word originally only has the meaning ""Etruscan"", although later both words' meanings get conflated.

*Lore*: the speakers of my conlang inhabit south of the Alps and have received a lot of influence from the Etruscans, the most important being the alphabet, followed by architecture, art, culture and government. Their culture has had such a great impact, that their demonym has become synonymous with anything regarded as elaborate.

I'm seeking further comments on what unique phonological features I can add to my language while still keeping it as pronounceable as could be.

So, without further ado, here you go.

## Syllable structure

Itiria's syllable structure is `(C(C))V(V)(C)`, with an optional onset and coda. All dotted consonants, _j_ and _w_ cannot be part of the coda, and with it, cannot end a word, unless lenition takes place across those words.

The onset can contain the following consonant clusters:

- Any consonant listed above
- Any plosive or fricative followed by a liquid

## Stress

Stress is on the penultimate, (and if there is no penultimate, the last syllable). If the word has long vowels, the last syllable with a long vowel is stressed.

Examples: _kaiṡa_ /ˈkʰäi.ɕɐ/ 'daughter', _kórýṅṁa_ /kʰoːˈɹɨːɲ.mʲɐ/ 'gauntlet'

If a word ends in a consonant and the next begins in a vowel, it is ""joined"" and pronounced as a single word.

If a monosyllabic word is long and is beside or between multisyllabic words, the monosyllabic is also stressed.

An example: _galėn ýl tåüla_ /gälənˈɨːl.tʰʌʏlɐ/ 'beyond _these_ walls'.

## Consonants

Each phoneme in Itiria is written with a single letter, and so does in its script (which I will be reserving for another time). Letters appear as in the IPA, with the following exceptions: _f_ /ɸ/, _v_ /β/, _þ_ /θ/, _ł_ /ɬ/, _c_ /ʦ/, _ċ_ /ʨ/, and _ġ_ /ʥ/.

Square and round brackets indicate the letter is co-articulated.

### Overdotting and palatalization

Almost all the consonants have dotted forms, which are palatal(ized) versions of their respective consonants.

These consonants appear only on their own, and cannot exist without another palatal consonant, excluding _j_. The palatalization spreads to all consonants in the cluster. For example, _vírṁä_ 'expanse' /βiːɹ.mʲæ/ -&gt; _víṙṁä_ /βiːɹʲ.mʲæ/.

| Plain         | IPA           | Palatalized   | IPA                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| _s z c_       | /s z ʦ/       | _ṡ ż ċ_       | /ɕ ʑ ʨ/             |
| _t d n l x w_ | /t d n l x w/ | _ṫ ḋ ṅ ŀ ẋ ẇ_ | /c ɟ ɲ ʎ ç ɥ/       |
| _p b f m r h_ | /p b ɸ m ɹ h/ | _ṗ ḃ ḟ ṁ ṙ ḣ_ | /pʲ bʲ ɸʲ mʲ ɹʲ hʲ/ |

Orthographically, _ġ_ is the only letter that does not obey this rule, but is the voiced counterpart of _ċ_ which does obey. _ġ_ is also used for the 'same' sound in Maltese /ʤ/.

#### Additional comments

- The ""post-alveolar"" consonants _ṡ ż ċ ġ_ /ɕ ʑ ʨ ʥ/ are alveolo-palatal, as in the Polish _ś ź ć dź_.
- _r_ is approximated, not trilled, as in English /ɹ/.
- _f_ and _v_ are truly bilabial, not labiodental.
- Intervocalic _j_ is fricated to /ʝ/.
- _ṫ_ and _ḋ_ are pronounced as palatal **plosives**, never affricates.
- _l_ after back vowels and velar consonants darkens to /ɫ/. This applies to /ɫː/ when _l_ is geminated: _allá_ /äˈɫːäː/
- Unvoiced plosives are aspirated at the beginning of a word and between vowels. Geminate unvoiced plosives are not aspirated.
- All consonants can be geminated. Gemination only happens between vowels, therefore the first ends a syllable and the other begins.

## Vowels

There are eleven vowels in Itiria: _a ä å e ė i o ö u ü y_, each with their long counterparts _á â ǻ é ě í ó ő ú ű ý_. Note that _ü_ is close-mid front rounded, _å_ is open-mid back **un**rounded, and _e_ is mid-open front. Long vowels occupy the length of two short vowels.

The single dot in _ė_ does not mean the vowel is fronted, but is distinct from _ä_, _ö_ and _ü_ which are marked with umlauts and are fronted.

Long vowels are marked with an acute _ˊ_ above each letter, except for the pair _ä_/_â_ and _ė_/_ě_, whose long forms are distinct in quality and length. These long vowels are instead marked with a circumflex _ˆ_ and caron _ˇ_ respectively, to indicate that the tongue is shifted up or down.

a is further backened to /ɐ/ at the end of words.

|           | Front short | Front long | Central short | Central long | Back short | Back long |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------- |

| Close-mid | ü /ʏ/       | ű /ʏː/     |               |              | |    |
| Mid-close | ö /ø/       | ő /øː/     |               |              | o /o/      | ó /oː/    |
| Mid       |             |            | ė /ə/         |              |            |           |
| Mid-open  | e /ɛ/       | é /ɛː/     |               | ě /ɜː/       | å /ʌ/      | ǻ /ʌː/    |
| Open-mid  |             | â /æː/     |               |              |            |           |
| Open      | ä /a/       |            | a /ä~ɐ/       | á /äː/       |            |           |

There is no vowel harmony.

Any short vowel can also form diphthongs with the short vowels _i_, _u_ and _ü_ as the second part of the diphthong, without duplicates. For example, _eu_ is pronounced as /ɛu/.

If two or more vowels are together and if they cannot form a diphthong, they are pronounced separately. _ae_ is pronounced as two syllables /ä.ɛ/.

e.g. (the name) _Zaia Korsua_, which is pronounced as /ˈzäi.ɐ kʰoɹˈsu.ɐ/.",Itiria Phonology and Romanization,"Älämre. (Okay.)

I've been working on Itiria's phonology and romanization (for perhaps a few days), looking back at the words I had published earlier. So before I go all out on making Itiria and further developing its vocab and lore I took some time out to plan its phonology (and romanization).

Anyway, here you go.

### Syllable structure

Itiria's syllable structure is `(C(C))V(V)(C)`, with an optional onset and coda. All dotted consonants, _j_ and _w_ cannot be part of the coda, and with it, cannot end a word, unless lenition takes place across those words.

The onset can contain the following consonant clusters:

- Any consonant listed above
- Any plosive or fricative followed by a liquid

### Stress

Stress is on the penultimate, (and if there is no penultimate, the last syllable). If the word has long vowels, the last syllable with a long vowel is stressed.

Examples: _kaiṡa_ /ˈkʰäi.ɕɐ/ 'daughter', _kórýṅṁa_ /kʰoːˈɹɨːɲ.mʲɐ/ 'gauntlet'

If a word ends in a consonant and the next begins in a vowel, it is ""joined"" and pronounced as a single word.

If a monosyllabic word is long and is beside or between multisyllabic words, the monosyllabic is also stressed.

An example: _galėn ýl tøüla_ /ˈgälənˈɨːl.ˈtʰʌʏlɐ/ 'beyond _these_ walls'.

### Consonants

Each phoneme in Itiria is written with a single letter, and so does in its script (which I will be reserving for another time). Letters appear as in the IPA, with the following exceptions: _f_ /ɸ/, _v_ /β/, _þ_ /θ/, _ł_ /ɬ/, _c_ /ʦ/, _ċ_ /ʨ/, _ġ_ /ʥ/, _ṩ_ /ɧ/.

|              | Bilabial | Dental | Alveolar | Alveolo-palatal | Palatal   | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
| ------------ | -------- | ------ | -------- | --------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| Plosives     | p ṗ b ḃ  |        | t d      |                 | ṫ ḋ       | k g   | q      |         |
| Fricatives   | f ḟ v    | þ ð    | s z [ł]  | ṡ ż             | ẋ         | x     |        | h ḣ     |
| Affricates   |          |        | c        | ċ ġ             |           |       |        |         |
| Nasals       | m ṁ      |        | n        |                 | ṅ         | ŋ     |        |         |

#### Overdotting and palatalization

A lot of letters have overdots, and these ""soften"" the consonant by palatalization. These consonants can end or begin a syllable, and the palatalization spreads to all consonants in the cluster. For example, _vírṁä_ 'expanse' /βiːɹ.mʲæ/ -&gt; _víṙṁä_ /βiːɹʲ.mʲæ/.

(There is no l-overdot so I used l-middle dot _ŀ_ instead).

| Plain         | IPA           | Palatalized   | IPA                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| _s z c_       | /s z ʦ/       | _ṡ ż ċ_       | /ɕ ʑ ʨ/             |
| _t d n l_     | /t d n l/     | _ṫ ḋ ṅ ŀ_     | /c ɟ ɲ ʎ/           |
| _x w_         | /x w/         | _ẋ ẇ_         | /ç ɥ/               |
| _p b f m r h_ | /p b ɸ m ɹ h/ | _ṗ ḃ ḟ ṁ ṙ ḣ_ | /pʲ bʲ ɸʲ mʲ ɹʲ hʲ/ |

Orthographically, _ġ_ is the only letter that does not obey this rule, but is the voiced counterpart of _ċ_ which does obey. _ġ_ is also used for the 'same' sound in Maltese /ʤ/. _ṩ_ is a combination of _ṡ_ and _x_.

#### Additional comments

- The ""post-alveolar"" consonants _ṡ ż ċ ġ_ /ɕ ʑ ʨ ʥ/ are alveolo-palatal, as in the Polish _ś ź ć dź_.
- _r_ is approximated, not trilled, as in English /ɹ/.
- _f_ and _v_ are truly bilabial, not labiodental.
- Intervocalic _j_ is fricated to /ʝ/.
- _ṫ ḋ_ are pronounced as palatal **plosives**, never affricates.
- _l_ after back vowels and velar consonants darkens to /ɫ/. The darkening continues to /ʟː/ when _l_ is geminated: _allá_ /äʟ.ˈʟäː/
- Unvoiced plosives are aspirated at the beginning of a word and between vowels. Geminate unvoiced plosives are not aspirated.
- All consonants can be geminated. Gemination only happens between vowels, therefore the first ends a syllable and the other begins.

### Vowels

There are eleven vowels in Itiria: _a ä e ė i o ö ø u ü y_, each with their long counterparts _á â é ě í ó ő ǿ ú ű ý_. Note that _ü_ is close-mid front rounded, _ø_ is open-mid **back un**rounded, and _e_ is mid-open front. Long vowels occupy the length of two short vowels.

The single dot in _ė_ does not mean the vowel is fronted, but is distinct from _ä_, _ö_ and _ü_ which are marked with umlauts and are fronted.

Long vowels are marked with an acute _ˊ_ above each letter, except for the pair _ä_/_â_ and _ė_/_ě_, whose long forms are distinct in quality and length. These long vowels are instead marked with a circumflex _ˆ_ and caron _ˇ_ respectively, to indicate that the tongue is shifted up or down.

a is further backened to /ɐ/ at the end of words.

There is no vowel harmony.

Any short vowel can also form diphthongs with the short vowels _i_, _u_ and _ü_ as the second part of the diphthong, without duplicates. For example, _eu_ is pronounced as /ɛu/.

If two or more vowels are together and if they cannot form a diphthong, they are pronounced separately. _ae_ is pronounced as two syllables /ä.ɛ/.

e.g. (the name) _Zaia Korsua_, which is pronounced as /ˈzäi.ɐ kʰoɹˈsu.ɐ/.",Itiria Phonology,"
I've been working on Itiria's phonology and romanization (for perhaps a few days), looking back at the words I had published earlier. So before I go all out on making Itiria and further developing its vocab and lore I took some time out to plan its phonology (and romanization).

Anyway, here you go.

### Syllable structure

Itiria's syllable structure is `(C(C))V(V)(C)`, with an optional onset and coda. All dotted consonants, _j_ and _w_ cannot be part of the coda, and with it, cannot end a word, unless lenition takes place across those words.

The onset can contain the following consonant clusters:

- Any consonant listed above
- Any plosive or fricative followed by a liquid

### Stress

Stress is on the penultimate, (and if there is no penultimate, the last syllable). If the word has long vowels, the last syllable with a long vowel is stressed.

Examples: _kaiṡa_ /ˈkʰäi.ɕɐ/ 'daughter', _kórýṅṁa_ /kʰoːˈɹɨːɲ.mʲɐ/ 'gauntlet'

If a word ends in a consonant and the next begins in a vowel, it is ""joined"" and pronounced as a single word.

If a monosyllabic word is long and is beside or between multisyllabic words, the monosyllabic is also stressed.

An example: _galėn ýl tøüla_ /ˈgälənˈɨːl.ˈtʰʌʏlɐ/ 'beyond _these_ walls'.

### Consonants

Each phoneme in Itiria is written with a single letter, and so does in its script (which I will be reserving for another time). Letters appear as in the IPA, with the following exceptions: _f_ /ɸ/, _v_ /β/, _þ_ /θ/, _ł_ /ɬ/, _c_ /ʦ/, _ċ_ /ʨ/, _ġ_ /ʥ/, _ṩ_ /ɧ/.

|              | Bilabial | Dental | Alveolar | Alveolo-palatal | Palatal   | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
| ------------ | -------- | ------ | -------- | --------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| Plosives     | p ṗ b ḃ  |        | t d      |                 | ṫ ḋ       | k g   | q      |         |
| Fricatives   | f ḟ v    | þ ð    | s z [ł]  | ṡ ż             | ẋ         | x     |        | h ḣ     |
| Affricates   |          |        | c        | ċ ġ             |           |       |        |         |
| Nasals       | m ṁ      |        | n        |                 | ṅ         | ŋ     |        |         |
| Approximants | (ẇ) (w)  |        | r ṙ      |                 | l ŀ j [ẇ] | [w]   |        |         |

#### Overdotting and palatalization

A lot of letters have overdots, and these ""soften"" the consonant by palatalization. These consonants can end or begin a syllable, and the palatalization spreads to all consonants in the cluster. For example, _vírṁä_ 'expanse' /βiːɹ.mʲæ/ -&gt; _víṙṁä_ /βiːɹʲ.mʲæ/.

(There is no l-overdot so I used l-middle dot _ŀ_ instead).

| Plain         | IPA           | Palatalized   | IPA                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| _s z c_       | /s z ʦ/       | _ṡ ż ċ_       | /ɕ ʑ ʨ/             |
| _t d n l_     | /t d n l/     | _ṫ ḋ ṅ ŀ_     | /c ɟ ɲ ʎ/           |
| _x w_         | /x w/         | _ẋ ẇ_         | /ç ɥ/               |
| _p b f m r h_ | /p b ɸ m ɹ h/ | _ṗ ḃ ḟ ṁ ṙ ḣ_ | /pʲ bʲ ɸʲ mʲ ɹʲ hʲ/ |

Orthographically, _ġ_ is the only letter that does not obey this rule, but is the voiced counterpart of _ċ_ which does obey. _ġ_ is also used for the 'same' sound in Maltese /ʤ/. _ṩ_ is a combination of _ṡ_ and _x_.

#### Additional comments

- The ""post-alveolar"" consonants _ṡ ż ċ ġ_ /ɕ ʑ ʨ ʥ/ are alveolo-palatal, as in the Polish _ś ź ć dź_.
- _r_ is approximated, not trilled, as in English /ɹ/.
- _f_ and _v_ are truly bilabial, not labiodental.
- Intervocalic _j_ is fricated to /ʝ/.
- _ṫ ḋ_ are pronounced as palatal **plosives**, never affricates.
- _l_ after back vowels and velar consonants darkens to /ɫ/. The darkening continues to /ʟː/ when _l_ is geminated: _allá_ /äʟ.ˈʟäː/
- Unvoiced plosives are aspirated at the beginning of a word and between vowels. Geminate unvoiced plosives are not aspirated.
- All consonants can be geminated. Gemination only happens between vowels, therefore the first ends a syllable and the other begins.

### Vowels

There are eleven vowels in Itiria: _a ä e ė i o ö ø u ü y_, each with their long counterparts _á â é ě í ó ő ǿ ú ű ý_. Note that _ü_ is close-mid front rounded, _ø_ is open-mid **back un**rounded, and _e_ is mid-open front. Long vowels occupy the length of two short vowels.

The single dot in _ė_ does not mean the vowel is fronted, but is distinct from _ä_, _ö_ and _ü_ which are marked with umlauts and are fronted.

Long vowels are marked with an acute _ˊ_ above each letter, except for the pair _ä_/_â_ and _ė_/_ě_, whose long forms are distinct in quality and length. These long vowels are instead marked with a circumflex _ˆ_ and caron _ˇ_ respectively, to indicate that the tongue is shifted up or down.

a is further backened to /ɐ/ at the end of words.

|           | Front short | Front long | Central short | Central long | Back short | Back long |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------- |
| Close     | i /i/       | í /iː/     | y /ɨ/         | ý /ɨː/       | u /u/      | ú /uː/    |

| Mid-close | ö /ø/       | ő /øː/     |               |              | o /o/      | ó /oː/    |

| Mid-open  | e /ɛ/       | é /ɛː/     |               | ě /ɜː/       | ø /ʌ/      | ǿ /ʌː/    |
| Open-mid  |             | â /æː/     |               |              |            |           |

I’m going for naturalism (at least phonologically), and I would appreciate others’ feedback on my work. Middle Na Xy Pakhtaq’s phoneme inventory looks like this:

Consonants:

||Bilabial|Alveolar|Palatal|Velar|Glottal|

|Aspirated|pʰ|tʰ|cʰ|kʰ||

Vowels: /ä i u/

The frequencies (rounded off to the nearest percent) for each consonant:

· 15% ŋ

· 13% l

· 11% pʰ

· 10% p

· 8% cʰ

· 7% c

· 6% tʰ

· 5% t

· 5% kʰ

· 4% k

· 3% c’

· 3% k’

This is an exponential distribution, and each phoneme is 7/8 as common as the preceding one. For vowels, each one is 3/4 as common as the last; the frequencies are 43% u, 32% ä, and 24% i. I chose an exponential distribution because [this paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.570895/full) suggests it is the most naturalistic (of the distributions the paper compared), although none of the distributions they tried were very accurate matches for natlangs. I’m going to use these frequencies in my word generator.

Middle Na Xy Pakhtaq’s syllable structure is (C)V(V)(C), with a 2/3 chance of an onset, a 2/3 chance of a coda, and a 1/3 chance of an extra vowel.

And here are the sound changes (C is a consonant, V is vowel, S is semivowel, # is a word boundary, and $ is a syllable boundary):

V→S/V\_V (the semivowel versions of /u ä i/ are /w ʕ j/)

V→S/VC\_V

V→S/V\_CV

V→S/V\_#

VC→\\\\/#\_#

u→y/$\_\[+palatal\]

u→y/\[+palatal\]\_$

\[+palatal\]→\[+velar\]

Modern Na Xy Pakhtaq now has the vowels /ä u i y/ plus the following consonants:

||Labial|Alveolar|Dorsal|Glottal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nasal|||ŋ||
|Ejective|||k'||
|Aspirated|pʰ|tʰ|kʰ||
|Unaspirated|p|t|k|ʔ|
|Approximant|w|l|j||

There are also the following changes, which are allophonic rules for Modern Na Xy Pakhtaq.

Firstly, stops lenit in a coda or intervocalically in unstressed syllables:

· /pʰ tʰ kʰ/ → \[ɸ s x\] / V\_$

· /pʰ tʰ kʰ/ → \[ɸ s x\] / V\_V in unstressed syllables

· \[-voiced -glottal\] → \[+voiced\] / V\_V in unstressed syllables

Nasal assimilation:

· /ŋ/ → \[n\] / \_\[+alveolar\]

· /ŋ/ → \[ɲ\] / \_\[+palatal\]

· /ŋ/ → \[m\] / \_\[+labial\] (including /w/)

Some consonants are affected by the following vowel:

· \[+velar\] → \[+palatal\] / {i, y}\_$ (instead of just merging earlier, I imagine that the palatals and velars changed so that they were in complementary distribution.)

· /l/ → \[ʎ\] / {i, y}\_$

· /l/ → \[ʟ\] / u\_$

Vowels also have some allophony:

· /i y u ä/ → \[e ø o ɜ\] in unstressed syllables.

· \[+vowel\] → \[+creaky\] / {\_ʔ$,$ʔ\_}

Half-way through my project I majorly revamped the proto-lang's grammar to something more like a Northwest Coast American language. I have stopped evolving the conlang for I've lost interest in continuing it.

I've learned a good deal about conlanging, linguistics, perfectionism, and burnout. The last two I had to learn the hard way.

While not best starting with grammar that was the polar opposite of English's, the end product was quite epic.

I hope you check it out and see what you think!

1716,0,"As part of an evolution of one of my languages, Akatli, I've accidentally stumbled upon tonal contour introductions as part of the minimal affixation rules I've employed in verbal constructions. Now I want to introduce that to the rest of my language, but I have some concerns over how it's being implemented - specifically, I'm using **vowel assimilation and elision** instead of the more-known consonant elisions found in various natlangs in the world.

So here's how it works so far:

* Vowel clusters of same tone (high/low) merge into a dipping tone (with an assumed middle step of a glottal stop between the vowels) if the vowels are equal OR the combination creates a legal diphthong /ai/ /aɔ/ /ɔu/. If a single consonant separates the two vowels, move the consonant to the end of the combined vowels.

Hi, all. Beowulf here. Do you like high-quality collaborative storytelling? Do you like in-depth worldbuilding? Do you like settings that blend the best of conlangs, politics, religion, and high technology? Then listen here, 'fella, because I've got something for you.

I've had a well-established science-fantasy universe, *Coda* (what you could call the Codaverse), in the works for quite some time. Our Discord project has been going for little over a year now, with a tightknit cohort of authors, visual artists, and even music-makers all contributing to a shared world - a world where the tribes of mankind have emerged from their interstellar diaspora forever changed. If you've got a lust for linguistics, myth, politics, philosophy, and even speculative biology, you'll be at home in this setting. Fittingly, its influences include The Elder Scrolls, Dune, and Warframe, though the overarching goal is originality above all else; don't expect to find carbon-copies of your favorite fiction here.

I'm pleased to announce we're looking for a few more members to add to our team. Specifically, we are looking for those interested in working with us on our conlang sub-project. This is a serious project for serious creatives, so we expect you to have some skills to bring to the table. Activity is a must (but we're all adults here, so we're aware that work, family, and health always come first!). Respect for others and their work and the ability to give and receive criticism are just as important. Otherwise, it's not all 'business'. We love to share memes, discuss all things nerdy, and even have nights where we play Minecraft. Ultimately, we're all in the server to create a truly unique and immersive science-fantasy universe that, hopefully, we might one day share with the world.

If you're interested, leave a comment below or contact me. I'd be happy to send our Codaverse: Introduction lore doc/short story your way so you know what it's actually all about. Best of luck, and thanks for checking this out!",The Codaverse: Science-Fantasy Setting Looking for Conlinguists,"

1735,0,"# Commutativity in languages

This post/article is a reflexion on a (personnal) speculative linguistic field that I am not properly wording, and which you probably didn't really think of. The concept is quite abstract and I am not sure I have given it a proper form. But I hope there is sth to eat and I will catch your attention and interest.

*P.-S.: I'm really not sure what flair to use.*

# 0) What is commutativity?

Commutativity is the property, for a given operation, when applied to given elements, to give the same results, whatever their order. It is mostly a property in mathematics that works for both addition and multiplication without applying to their respective reverse operations, substraction and division. It happens though to also not apply to exponentiation (both to the power and to the root).

To give an example, 3+5 = 5+3, and 3x5 = 5x3, but 3-5 is not 5-3, nor is 3/5 equal to 5/3 (nor is 3^(5) equal to 5^(3)).

# 1) Commutativity in language

There are several ways in which commutativity (or its negation) can play a role in language.

Overall, obviously, the field of language concerned with it (and negating or limiting commutativity) is syntax, or word order. Given a set of words, ordering these words can create phrases that are either sensical or unsensical, or sometimes somewhere inbetween, being somewhat meaningful, but not really expected.

The case for commutativity in language though, applies best where we have two sets of the same words in 2 different orders, with just 2 words being interchanged. And it is even more interesting and direct where they have just next to each other.

# 2) Language doesn't seem to like commutativity?

When you consider languages under that question, you will notice how, in a way, language simply doesn't really like commutativity. Or to put it another way, in a sense, language likes to do overkill. Let me explain.

If you take a given set of words like for instance, in English, ""cat, James', The, restaurant, entered, black"", you will not be able to create many possible sentences. Actually, only ""The black cat entered James' restaurant"" is really possible. Now, for sure, I did use some tricks, but in general, if you break down a sentence, you will typically get 2/3 possible reorderings and not much more.

All in all, it seems to me that, in general, the way commutativity applies is mainly 1) which epithets (adjective phrases) connects to which noun phrase 2) commutativity between subject and object. 1 is probably the one which is the most typical to occur, and in my example above it would have occurred had I not indicated the capital letter. But then it's hard to avoid this ""problem"", and it's not as interesting as the 2nd one.

Now for subject and object, this indeed is the commutativity that will typically occurs in English. ""The cobra bites the viper"" is not the same as ""The viper bites the cobra"".

Another typical case is with direct and indirect object. For instance, ""I gave a man a city"", ""I gave a city a man"". ""give"" in English is supposed to be followed by indirect object, then direct object. Btw, since we're on that, this is one the grammatical features that dolphins proved capable of ( [(PDF) Language Research: Dolphins (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342706263_Language_Research_Dolphins)).

But you may feel sth. I had to pick up special examples to have actual commutativity, like selecting two snakes and an action relating to snakes. If it were a cobra and a human, you would know what's the subject, well, the expected one.

Not only that, but you may notice how commutativity can be ""fought"" with cases declensions. With conjugation (""el gato persigue a pajares"", ""the cat hunts birds"", not only is it expected the subject be cat, but the conjugation also indicates it; I used Spanish because, even though this works in English as well, in many other cases it would only work there there are more conjugation distinctions, in all tenses). Or, taking my examples of verbs with direct and indirect objects, the latter will often be persons, and be pronouns or proper nouns, and the former be items, as noun phrases.

Even the attribution of qualifiers to what they qualify, typically adjectives, can sometimes be rendered clearly with the use of case markers or/and gender, when the adjective follow that of what it qualifies.

I think the fact that actual commutativity with a meaningful distinction is (seems) rare can be attributed to the overall principle that language doesn't like too much information density, where changing just a word would change significantly the meaning of the sentence. It thus likes ""overkill"", with excessive help to clarify the meaning (context, cumulation of several grammatical features for a same use, idiomatic and repetitive phrases, etc.) so that speakers can communicate while paying full attention to just 70% of what is being said, so to speak.

All that said, there is still some room for commutativity in language in special interesting cases. I will focus on cases where the two words directly follow each other.

I must signal right away that commutativity here will actually be used to rather mean sth like ""differentiating commutativity"", that is, a case where commuting words make the sentence still mean something, but something *different*. When this is not the case, you could say there is indifferentiating commutativity"". I think though that my case hints for both commutativities being unnatural in language (the indifferentiating one reduces ""overkill"" hints for meaning - you could say for prediction, and the differentiating one augments the required (over)attention from both speaker and listener.

Btw, I tried to google my point and find a piece about it, I think this is relevant:  [Prediction in language comprehension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_in_language_comprehension#Evidence_from_event-related_potentials)  

# 3) An example of an absent commutativity - Spanish

There is an interesting case of commutativity in Spanish that could exist but doesn't. While conceiving the idea for this post, I thought, wait, wasn't there this ""no ya"" / ""ya no"" thing? This would 've been an interesting case. But then, it's true that I had yet never heard ""no ya"" actually used.

The idea, which I'm pretty sure I had learned in some manuel book, was that ""ya no"" means ""not anymore"" and ""no ya"" ""not yet"". Let me explain.

No, obviously, is the adverb of negation. ""ya"" means ""already"", basically. Thus, ""ya no"" means ""not anymore"". It's already the case that it's not. For instance, ""ya no lo tengo"", it's already the case (ya) that I don't (no) have (tengo) it (lo), I don't have/possess it anymore.

But what would ""No ya lo tengo""? To really get how it works, I think the best is to deal with packets, using commas. ""ya (no lo tengo)"", it's already the case (that I don't have it). Thus ""no (ya lo tengo)"", it is not the case (that I already have it)"", thus it would be understood as ""I don't have it yet"".

Yet the thing is that you don't say that in Spanish. To render that meaning, you rather use ""Todavia (still), no"". Note how ""no"" positions in the same place as for ""ya no"".

# 4) Commutativity in constructed languages - the case of Esperanto

In other words, it's not *natural* for such cases of commutativity to appear. Thus, maybe it is something that should appear - artificially?

After realizing that this ""no ya"" thing was definitely not a thing (even though it theoretically could), I had the intuition that it could perhaps have come from Esperanto.

Now, Esperanto is a special case. It is a constructed language, not a natlang; that being said, its natural use through decades in the Esperantist community, as well as its aiming at naturalism and being a posteriori, not a purely a priori language, can interfere with its a priori feature. So maybe we should expect an intermediate commutativity to appear here?

Well, in Esperanto, my intuition was right, ""jam (ya) ... ne (no)"" exists, including in the Fundamento, with the meaning of ""not anymore"", just like ""ya no"". What about ""ne jam""? Well, it *does* exist, and is sometimes used, but just *occasionnally in a few resources*. And it *does* mean *""not yet""*. Exactly what we could expect!

# 5) The case of Bleep

**a) An introduction to Bleep and a short note on its restrictiveness**

Bleep is a Toki-Pona-inspired language made by u/good-mcrn-ing with very special concepts in mind. I guess you already know Toki Pona, an oligosynthetic language with a core vocabulary limited to 120-137 root-words, where you want to speak in a simple way, not using too many words and details, but where you can potentially give more nuance and meaning by adding words, typically adjective nouns. A classic example, jan means ""person"", ""pona"" means ""good (to me)"", so ""jan pona"" means a friend. And you could add more words to specify the meaning.

Bleep overall takes the same concept, but limits even further its vocabulary to just 100 words, and they are only either ""nouns"" (includes ""pronouns"") or ""verbs"" (includes what you would label ""adjectives"" - it's similar to Chinese to that regard). And it literally refuses to put a noun after another one to qualify it, like an adjective. The only way to specify/qualify a word is to add a verb, thus to add a subclause. Thus, if you wanted to say ""jan pona"", you could say for instance ""ki no we"" or ""ki no we wa"" (""ki"" means person, ""no"" starts an adjective clause, ""we"" means to benefit, be good, ""wa"" means me).

This is added to the fact that the only allowed syntax for a clause is (S) V (O), with either S or O optional. To attach clauses, you either attach a clause to (after) a noun with ""clause-initial particles"", or you attach an adverbial clause to another one by placing it before and using ""ola ... lo"".

At first, I thought that this restrictiveness was weird - and somewhat artificial. But there is something to it.

You see, Bleep is clearly doing overkill. Ambiguity-wise, there is no, apparent at least, reason to decide such a restrictiveness in both words order and words category. If words always follow SVO, you should be able to use nouns as verbs and verbs as nouns (to be fair, there's the special case where S or O is omitted, but it would require little change to fix that), and reversely if words are always of one specific category, you should be able to attach nouns to other nouns and verbs to other verbs (to further develop the meaning). This could help the vocabulary in several regards. But in addition to what the creator explains of his motives, you could argue that it helps speakers in letting them expect what comes in a sentence. That's why I used the word ""overkill"", already used above. The speaker doesn't have to interprete words specifically according to word order, or reversely to their status, since both contribute to it.

In other words, expectation-friendly templates, so to phrase it, is a linguistic natural feature that even a priori languages (in the restricted meaning of the term) can spontaneously want to adopt.

**b) Clause-initial particles in Bleep**

That being said, there is room for commutativity in Bleep, specifically with clause-initial particles. These do not just help to attach a clause to a noun, but they can also specify the meaning of a clause. Among them, there is notably ""so"" (""it is possible that...""), ""e"" (""it is not the case that..."") and ""pi"" (""it starts being the case that...""). Let us take the following clause: ""ki wapo (consume, eat, drink) simi (building)"". On its own, it means ""People eat buildings"" (as their casual diet). If we wanted it to be a specified instance, like ""someone ate a building"", we would need the clause-initial ""ni"", but it's a more complex one, we'll limit to the 3 aforementioned.

Now, the point is to play with ""e"" (""not"") ""so"" (""possible"") and ""pi"" (starts). I let you think about it.

You're on it? Ok, here is the idea. Obviously there are many possible combinations (40 if we can use 0 to 1 iteration of each), but we'll limit to the following ones:

What is **pi ki wapo simi**? That's right! People have started eating buildings!

What is **e ki wapo simi**? That's right, it's the fictive scenario where people *don't* eat buildings. Yeah, I like SF too, it would be a nice uchronia.

What is **so pi ki wapo simi**? Yes, people may start eating building.

How about **e so e ki wapo simi**? Well, ""e so e"" is the official phrasing for the idea of necessity. It means ""People must eat building"". Lit. it means ""It can't be that it be possible for people not to eat buildings"".

**c) (differentiating) Commutativity in Bleep**

I guess you can see where this goes. ""so pi ki wapo simi"" means ""people may start eating building"", while ""pi so ki wapo simi"" means sth like ""People start being able to eat buildings"". ""e so ki wapo simi"" means ""People can't eat buildings"", while ""so e ki wapo simi"" means ""People are allowed/able not to eat buildings"". **e so** means sth different from **so e**, **pi so** from **so pi**, **pi e** from **e pi**, etc. If you add ""na"" (ĉu), ""ni"" (a specified instance), and ""ka"" (past), you can play with them and do interesting stuff.

# 5) Adjectives order

This part deals with sth a bit different, but it will help enlarging our perspective on the matters, and will be useful for our next part.

**a) Adjectives order in English and other languages**

Since you're into languages, you may have heard of the famous adjectives order rule in English, quite universally used, unconsciously, by speaker. Here is a link to it:  [Wiktionary:English adjectives - Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:English_adjectives) (first section)

If for instance you have ""little"", ""wooden"", ""neat"", and ""black"" to describe a box, you know you should say ""a neat little black wooden box"", in this order.

This ofc can be a case of refusing commutativity in natural languages, here English, but that is not the only point. It is also an example of how you can analyze a list of words playing the same role.

Why are opinion-type adjective supposed to come first? Because you can have an opinion on a matter,colour etc.-specified box, but you don't (say the) ""colour"" (of) an opinion-specified object. The box is always what it is before you have an opinion on it. In other words, it's a neat (little black wooden box). Similarly, a box of a specific material can be coloured, but you can't change the material of a box with a specified colour. It's a black (wooden box). And so on, and overall the phrase could be written as a neat (little (black (wooden (box) ) ) ).

So what happens in other languages? Well, languages with qualifyer-first will follow a similar pattern to English; then, there are languages with the reverse word order, qualifyer coming after the qualified, as in Romance languages. What happens in this case?

In theory, you would get ( ( ( (box) wooden) black) little). You see, it can look at a first glance as a reverse adjectives order, but in the end it's the same.

But I say in theory, because in practice, in Romance languages at least, the qualified-qualifyer order is more fluid, with adjectives that come before the noun. I think there are other pieces of explanation for why the English adjectives order specifically is very famous and clear.

**b) Hints order in Concept.**

I love using the example of the board game Concept. It can look out of place, but it's really on point. In Concept, you describe phrases using hints that you place on symbols. There are about 120 symbols, which very interestingly is close to the number of words in Toki Pona. The symbols represent concepts like ""long"", ""quick"", ""do"" etc. Combining them, you get words and phrases.

So actually, Concept is a language game. This board game has invented its own language! Isn't that neat, though? (ofc, there is much ambiguity and it's not always easy to understand the word, but...)

So, all this said, to construct words/phrases, you first place a green hint ""?"" on a symbol indicating the category, and additional green cubes on symbols to specify the category. You then add ""!"" of colours to symbols indicating additional info about the word/phrase, with the cubes of their respective colours.

As you see, this brings us again to adjectives order. The ""?"" is similar to the noun ""box"", then you add adjectives to specify the meaning. You can indicate the colour, the country it's related to, etc. Does that mean this info comes in a specific order? Well, having played many games, I can tell you it's pretty chaotic. But I think there's room for a nice article on it. Not just this aspect, but the whole game, it can tell us a lot of stuff about language.

Note how in this case, we have a little-differentiating commutativity. *(to really get the whole of it, note how a colour symbol can be used to indicate the colour of the thing, but also the flag of the country it's related to)*

**c) Adjective noun order in Toki Pona and Hujemi.**

Anyway. In Toki Pona, there is the same question, with adjectives following each other. Note the difference between the following stuffs (little comment because ~~I get pretty tired~~ I don't want to make this post too long):

soweli (animal) suli (heavy) mute (many)

kiwen lawa (egg) loje (red) lili (little)

jan (person) pona (good) sina (you) = your friend

jan sina pona (a good relative of yours?)

You can find undifferentiating commutativity (but the language evolving and its speakers practicing can put the adjectives in order and restrict or negate the commutativity) as well as differentiating commutativity (in the two last examples).

Hujemi is an oligosynesthetic language (that I invented) where every phoneme is associated to one meaning; vowels helping specifying the meaning of initial consonants.

In hujemi, a word should start with the category of the thing, like in Concept. If it's an animal, you will say ""zo"", if it's an object/item, ""co"", etc. Now, take the snake from the Bible Genesis, and suppose you want to render it with ""long animal that thinks"". In this case, you would say ""zolãxu"". zo = animal, lã = long, ""xu"" (thu) means ""think"". (zolã)xu, long-animal that thinks, that makes sense, but (zoxu)lã, thinking-animal that is long? that's less expected. In most cases, you build it up in this way, seeing what is said about, what is the category, what's the added info.

# 6) Vowels order in Hujemi

This leads us to vowels order in hujemi though.

To really help understand what this is about, note that, even though I constructed the language, it is an engelang based on defined premises that I elaborated on, discovering what it could then mean, how it would work, and, thus, to a large extent, I can say with Michelangelo ""Ho visto un angelo nel marmo ed ho scolpito fino a liberarlo."" (even though I don't pretend it's necessarily an angel, it might be a mere bird). 

Vowels in hujemi code for a rather grammatical meaning/role. ""a"" means ""main, definite"", ""o"" is indefinite, example, ""e"" = element, context, origin, adverb, ablative, ""i"" = qualifying, connecting, adjective, ""u"" = verb, action, and ""ã"" = accusative, direction.

From that, I elaborated, constructing vowels-based particles with a grammatical role. If ""i"" introduces an adjective or sth of the sort, ""ia"", introduces a possessor. ""a"" introduces a definite ""noun"", ""au"" a definite ""noun"" that is the subject of the action, and ""ai"" a definite ""noun"" which is qualified by what follows. For instance, ""da"" meaning ""man (human)"", ""iada"" means ""of the man""; ""gi"" meaning ""great/big"", ""aigi"" is ""the great"", ""augi"" is ""the one that is being/doing great"".

But vowels also come after consonant-roots, to specify their meaning. ""la"" is the sea (a = main, definite...), le is water, re is fire, pa is forest or tree, etc.

But what if you add two vowels? Well, ""lai"" would mean ""marine"" (sea-related), ""lia"" would mean ""the freedom"" (li = free), and ""lua"" would mean lake/river (the one that streams).

Do you see what's interesting? I didn't intend that, but I reversed vowels. i-a-gi means ""of-the-great"", a-i-gi means ""the great one"", while ga-i means ""civilizational"" (ga = civilization, empire), and ""gia"" means ""the greatness"".

Once again, using commas helps. What matters is what comes the closest to the root. If you take ""iagi"", you can write it as i(a(gi)), where a(gi) means the(great), thus i(agi) means connected-to(the-great), ""of-the-great"". Similarly a(igi) = the(great).

But if you take gai and gia, it's the opposite. (ga)i means (civilisation)related, and (gi)a means (great)""main"". Similarly, (la)i means (sea)related, while (li)a means (free)main. And (lu)a means (streaming)main.

# 7) So what

Here is what I take from all of this:

1) Language seems to not want to have meaningful, either differentiating or indifferentiating, commutativity, especially for words close to each other. In other words, when you have two different words, you can generally tell which one comes first.

2) This can be attached to a general idea in language: you want to have prediction/expectiveness to some extent; you don't want to pay attention to every word (to the cost of not grasping the meaning, maybe even getting a totally wrong one), nor to never be able to predict, to some extent, the next word.

3) Engelangs can deal with this, when they don't plan on being naturalistic.

*That being said,*

You probably should consider that, for a given meaning, a minimal set of script strokes on one hand, a minimal set of phonemes on the other, are already two different things, ***but it is also not the same*** to have the meaning perfectly unambiguous in theory, and to have it unambiguous in reality for humans that will not fully pay attention to each phoneme, that will mix up some, etc. If there is at least one useful thing to take from this post, this might be. As indirect and weird my approach may look.

# 8) What about your language?

Does it allow for predictiveness? Is there commutativity of some sort in it?",Commutativity in languages,"# Commutativity in languages

This post/article is a reflexion on a (personnal) speculative linguistic field that I am not properly wording, and which you probably didn't really think of. The concept is quite abstract and I am not sure I have given it a proper form. But I hope there is sth to eat and I will catch your attention and interest.

*P.-S.: I'm really not sure what flair to use.*

# 0) What is commutativity?

Commutativity is the property, for a given operation, when applied to given elements, to give the same results, whatever their order. It is mostly a property in mathematics that works for both addition and multiplication without applying to their respective reverse operations, substraction and division. It happens though to also not apply to exponentiation (both to the power and to the root).

To give an example, 3+5 = 5+3, and 3x5 = 5x3, but 3-5 is not 5-3, nor is 3/5 equal to 5/3 (nor is 3^(5) equal to 5^(3)).

# 1) Commutativity in language

There are several ways in which commutativity (or its negation) can play a role in language.

Overall, obviously, the field of language concerned with it (and negating or limiting commutativity) is syntax, or word order. Given a set of words, ordering these words can create phrases that are either sensical or unsensical, or sometimes somewhere inbetween, being somewhat meaningful, but not really expected.

The case for commutativity in language though, applies best where we have two sets of the same words in 2 different orders, with just 2 words being interchanged. And it is even more interesting and direct where they have just next to each other.

# 2) Language doesn't seem to like commutativity?

When you consider languages under that question, you will notice how, in a way, language simply doesn't really like commutativity. Or to put it another way, in a sense, language likes to do overkill. Let me explain.

If you take a given set of words like for instance, in English, ""cat, James', The, restaurant, entered, black"", you will not be able to create many possible sentences. Actually, only ""The black cat entered James' restaurant"" is really possible. Now, for sure, I did use some tricks, but in general, if you break down a sentence, you will typically get 2/3 possible reorderings and not much more.

All in all, it seems to me that, in general, the way commutativity applies is mainly 1) which epithets (adjective phrases) connects to which noun phrase 2) commutativity between subject and object. 1 is probably the one which is the most typical to occur, and in my example above it would have occurred had I not indicated the capital letter. But then it's hard to avoid this ""problem"", and it's not as interesting as the 2nd one.

Now for subject and object, this indeed is the commutativity that will typically occurs in English. ""The cobra bites the viper"" is not the same as ""The viper bites the cobra"".

Another typical case is with direct and indirect object. For instance, ""I gave a man a city"", ""I gave a city a man"". ""give"" in English is supposed to be followed by indirect object, then direct object. Btw, since we're on that, this is one the grammatical features that dolphins proved capable of ( [(PDF) Language Research: Dolphins (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342706263_Language_Research_Dolphins)).

But you may feel sth. I had to pick up special examples to have actual commutativity, like selecting two snakes and an action relating to snakes. If it were a cobra and a human, you would know what's the subject, well, the expected one.

Not only that, but you may notice how commutativity can be ""fought"" with cases declensions. With conjugation (""el gato persigue a pajares"", ""the cat hunts birds"", not only is it expected the subject be cat, but the conjugation also indicates it; I used Spanish because, even though this works in English as well, in many other cases it would only work there there are more conjugation distinctions, in all tenses). Or, taking my examples of verbs with direct and indirect objects, the latter will often be persons, and be pronouns or proper nouns, and the former be items, as noun phrases.

Even the attribution of qualifiers to what they qualify, typically adjectives, can sometimes be rendered clearly with the use of case markers or/and gender, when the adjective follow that of what it qualifies.

I think the fact that actual commutativity with a meaningful distinction is (seems) rare can be attributed to the overall principle that language doesn't like too much information density, where changing just a word would change significantly the meaning of the sentence. It thus likes ""overkill"", with excessive help to clarify the meaning (context, cumulation of several grammatical features for a same use, idiomatic and repetitive phrases, etc.) so that speakers can communicate while paying full attention to just 70% of what is being said, so to speak.

All that said, there is still some room for commutativity in language in special interesting cases. I will focus on cases where the two words directly follow each other.

I must signal right away that commutativity here will actually be used to rather mean sth like ""differentiating commutativity"", that is, a case where commuting words make the sentence still mean something, but something *different*. When this is not the case, you could say there is indifferentiating commutativity"". I think though that my case hints for both commutativities being unnatural in language (the indifferentiating one reduces ""overkill"" hints for meaning - you could say for prediction, and the differentiating one augments the required (over)attention from both speaker and listener.

Btw, I tried to google my point and find a piece about it, I think this is relevant:  [Prediction in language comprehension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_in_language_comprehension#Evidence_from_event-related_potentials)  

# 3) An example of an absent commutativity - Spanish

There is an interesting case of commutativity in Spanish that could exist but doesn't. While conceiving the idea for this post, I thought, wait, wasn't there this ""no ya"" / ""ya no"" thing? This would 've been an interesting case. But then, it's true that I had yet never heard ""no ya"" actually used.

The idea, which I'm pretty sure I had learned in some manuel book, was that ""ya no"" means ""not anymore"" and ""no ya"" ""not yet"". Let me explain.

No, obviously, is the adverb of negation. ""ya"" means ""already"", basically. Thus, ""ya no"" means ""not anymore"". It's already the case that it's not. For instance, ""ya no lo tengo"", it's already the case (ya) that I don't (no) have (tengo) it (lo), I don't have/possess it anymore.

But what would ""No ya lo tengo""? To really get how it works, I think the best is to deal with packets, using commas. ""ya (no lo tengo)"", it's already the case (that I don't have it). Thus ""no (ya lo tengo)"", it is not the case (that I already have it)"", thus it would be understood as ""I don't have it yet"".

Yet the thing is that you don't say that in Spanish. To render that meaning, you rather use ""Todavia (still), no"". Note how ""no"" positions in the same place as for ""ya no"".

# 4) Commutativity in constructed languages - the case of Esperanto

In other words, it's not *natural* for such cases of commutativity to appear. Thus, maybe it is something that should appear - artificially?

After realizing that this ""no ya"" thing was definitely not a thing (even though it theoretically could), I had the intuition that it could perhaps have come from Esperanto.

Now, Esperanto is a special case. It is a constructed language, not a natlang; that being said, its natural use through decades in the Esperantist community, as well as its aiming at naturalism and being a posteriori, not a purely a priori language, can interfere with its a priori feature. So maybe we should expect an intermediate commutativity to appear here?

Well, in Esperanto, my intuition was right, ""jam (ya) ... ne (no)"" exists, including in the Fundamento, with the meaning of ""not anymore"", just like ""ya no"". What about ""ne jam""? Well, it *does* exist, and is sometimes used, but just *occasionnally in a few resources*. And it *does* mean *""not yet""*. Exactly what we could expect!

# 5) The case of Bleep

**a) An introduction to Bleep and a short note on its restrictiveness**

Bleep is a Toki-Pona-inspired language made by u/good-mcrn-ing with very special concepts in mind. I guess you already know Toki Pona, an oligosynthetic language with a core vocabulary limited to 120-137 root-words, where you want to speak in a simple way, not using too many words and details, but where you can potentially give more nuance and meaning by adding words, typically adjective nouns. A classic example, jan means ""person"", ""pona"" means ""good (to me)"", so ""jan pona"" means a friend. And you could add more words to specify the meaning.

Bleep overall takes the same concept, but limits even further its vocabulary to just 100 words, and they are only either ""nouns"" (includes ""pronouns"") or ""verbs"" (includes what you would label ""adjectives"" - it's similar to Chinese to that regard). And it literally refuses to put a noun after another one to qualify it, like an adjective. The only way to specify/qualify a word is to add a verb, thus to add a subclause. Thus, if you wanted to say ""jan pona"", you could say for instance ""ki no we"" or ""ki no we wa"" (""ki"" means person, ""no"" starts an adjective clause, ""we"" means to benefit, be good, ""wa"" means me).

This is added to the fact that the only allowed syntax for a clause is (S) V (O), with either S or O optional. To attach clauses, you either attach a clause to (after) a noun with ""clause-initial particles"", or you attach an adverbial clause to another one by placing it before and using ""ola ... lo"".

At first, I thought that this restrictiveness was weird - and somewhat artificial. But there is something to it.

You see, Bleep is clearly doing overkill. Ambiguity-wise, there is no, apparent at least, reason to decide such a restrictiveness in both words order and words category. If words always follow SVO, you should be able to use nouns as verbs and verbs as nouns (to be fair, there's the special case where S or O is omitted, but it would require little change to fix that), and reversely if words are always of one specific category, you should be able to attach nouns to other nouns and verbs to other verbs (to further develop the meaning). This could help the vocabulary in several regards. But in addition to what the creator explains of his motives, you could argue that it helps speakers in letting them expect what comes in a sentence. That's why I used the word ""overkill"", already used above. The speaker doesn't have to interprete words specifically according to word order, or reversely to their status, since both contribute to it.

In other words, expectation-friendly templates, so to phrase it, is a linguistic natural feature that even a priori languages (in the restricted meaning of the term) can spontaneously want to adopt.

**b) Clause-initial particles in Bleep**

That being said, there is room for commutativity in Bleep, specifically with clause-initial particles. These do not just help to attach a clause to a noun, but they can also specify the meaning of a clause. Among them, there is notably ""so"" (""it is possible that...""), ""e"" (""it is not the case that..."") and ""pi"" (""it starts being the case that...""). Let us take the following clause: ""ki wapo (consume, eat, drink) simi (building)"". On its own, it means ""People eat buildings"" (as their casual diet). If we wanted it to be a specified instance, like ""someone ate a building"", we would need the clause-initial ""ni"", but it's a more complex one, we'll limit to the 3 aforementioned.

Now, the point is to play with ""e"" (""not"") ""so"" (""possible"") and ""pi"" (starts). I let you think about it.

You're on it? Ok, here is the idea. Obviously there are many possible combinations (40 if we can use 0 to 1 iteration of each), but we'll limit to the following ones:

What is **pi ki wapo simi**? That's right! People have started eating buildings!

What is **e ki wapo simi**? That's right, it's the fictive scenario where people *don't* eat buildings. Yeah, I like SF too, it would be a nice uchronia.

What is **so pi ki wapo simi**? Yes, people may start eating building.

How about **e so e ki wapo simi**? Well, ""e so e"" is the official phrasing for the idea of necessity. It means ""People must eat building"". Lit. it means ""It can't be that it be possible for people not to eat buildings"".

**c) (differentiating) Commutativity in Bleep**

I guess you can see where this goes. ""so pi ki wapo simi"" means ""people may start eating building"", while ""pi so ki wapo simi"" means sth like ""People start being able to eat buildings"". ""e so ki wapo simi"" means ""People can't eat buildings"", while ""so e ki wapo simi"" means ""People are allowed/able not to eat buildings"". **e so** means sth different from **so e**, **pi so** from **so pi**, **pi e** from **e pi**, etc. If you add ""na"" (ĉu), ""ni"" (a specified instance), and ""ka"" (past), you can play with them and do interesting stuff.

# 5) Adjectives order

This part deals with sth a bit different, but it will help enlarging our perspective on the matters, and will be useful for our next part.

**a) Adjectives order in English and other languages**

Since you're into languages, you may have heard of the famous adjectives order rule in English, quite universally used, unconsciously, by speaker. Here is a link to it:  [Wiktionary:English adjectives - Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:English_adjectives) (first section)

If for instance you have ""little"", ""wooden"", ""neat"", and ""black"" to describe a box, you know you should say ""a neat little black wooden box"", in this order.

This ofc can be a case of refusing commutativity in natural languages, here English, but that is not the only point. It is also an example of how you can analyze a list of words playing the same role.

Why are opinion-type adjective supposed to come first? Because you can have an opinion on a matter,colour etc.-specified box, but you don't (say the) ""colour"" (of) an opinion-specified object. The box is always what it is before you have an opinion on it. In other words, it's a neat (little black wooden box). Similarly, a box of a specific material can be coloured, but you can't change the material of a box with a specified colour. It's a black (wooden box). And so on, and overall the phrase could be written as a neat (little (black (wooden (box) ) ) ).

So what happens in other languages? Well, languages with qualifyer-first will follow a similar pattern to English; then, there are languages with the reverse word order, qualifyer coming after the qualified, as in Romance languages. What happens in this case?

In theory, you would get ( ( ( (box) wooden) black) little). You see, it can look at a first glance as a reverse adjectives order, but in the end it's the same.

But I say in theory, because in practice, in Romance languages at least, the qualified-qualifyer order is more fluid, with adjectives that come before the noun. I think there are other pieces of explanation for why the English adjectives order specifically is very famous and clear.

**b) Hints order in Concept.**

I love using the example of the board game Concept. It can look out of place, but it's really on point. In Concept, you describe phrases using hints that you place on symbols. There are about 120 symbols, which very interestingly is close to the number of words in Toki Pona. The symbols represent concepts like ""long"", ""quick"", ""do"" etc. Combining them, you get words and phrases.

So actually, Concept is a language game. This board game has invented its own language! Isn't that neat, though? (ofc, there is much ambiguity and it's not always easy to understand the word, but...)

So, all this said, to construct words/phrases, you first place a green hint ""?"" on a symbol indicating the category, and additional green cubes on symbols to specify the category. You then add ""!"" of colours to symbols indicating additional info about the word/phrase, with the cubes of their respective colours.

As you see, this brings us again to adjectives order. The ""?"" is similar to the noun ""box"", then you add adjectives to specify the meaning. You can indicate the colour, the country it's related to, etc. Does that mean this info comes in a specific order? Well, having played many games, I can tell you it's pretty chaotic. But I think there's room for a nice article on it. Not just this aspect, but the whole game, it can tell us a lot of stuff about language.

Note how in this case, we have a little-differentiating commutativity. *(to really get the whole of it, note how a colour symbol can be used to indicate the colour of the thing, but also the flag of the country it's related to)*

**c) Adjective noun order in Toki Pona and Hujemi.**

Anyway. In Toki Pona, there is the same question, with adjectives following each other. Note the difference between the following stuffs (little comment because ~~I get pretty tired~~ I don't want to make this post too long):

soweli (animal) suli (heavy) mute (many)

kiwen lawa (egg) loje (red) lili (little)

jan (person) pona (good) sina (you) = your friend

jan sina pona (a good relative of yours?)

You can find undifferentiating commutativity (but the language evolving and its speakers practicing can put the adjectives in order and restrict or negate the commutativity) as well as differentiating commutativity (in the two last examples).

Hujemi is an oligosynesthetic language (that I invented) where every phoneme is associated to one meaning; vowels helping specifying the meaning of initial consonants.

In hujemi, a word should start with the category of the thing, like in Concept. If it's an animal, you will say ""zo"", if it's an object/item, ""co"", etc. Now, take the snake from the Bible Genesis, and suppose you want to render it with ""long animal that thinks"". In this case, you would say ""zolãxu"". zo = animal, lã = long, ""xu"" (thu) means ""think"". (zolã)xu, long-animal that thinks, that makes sense, but (zoxu)lã, thinking-animal that is long? that's less expected. In most cases, you build it up in this way, seeing what is said about, what is the category, what's the added info.

# 6) Vowels order in Hujemi

This leads us to vowels order in hujemi though.

To really help understand what this is about, note that, even though I constructed the language, it is an engelang based on defined premises that I elaborated on, discovering what it could then mean, how it would work, and, thus, to a large extent, I can say with Michelangelo ""Ho visto un angelo nel marmo ed ho scolpito fino a liberarlo."" (even though I don't pretend it's necessarily an angel, it might be a mere bird). 

Vowels in hujemi code for a rather grammatical meaning/role. ""a"" means ""main, definite"", ""o"" is indefinite, example, ""e"" = element, context, origin, adverb, ablative, ""i"" = qualifying, connecting, adjective, ""u"" = verb, action, and ""ã"" = accusative, direction.

From that, I elaborated, constructing vowels-based particles with a grammatical role. If ""i"" introduces an adjective or sth of the sort, ""ia"", introduces a possessor. ""a"" introduces a definite ""noun"", ""au"" a definite ""noun"" that is the subject of the action, and ""ai"" a definite ""noun"" which is qualified by what follows. For instance, ""da"" meaning ""man (human)"", ""iada"" means ""of the man""; ""gi"" meaning ""great/big"", ""aigi"" is ""the great"", ""augi"" is ""the one that is being/doing great"".

But vowels also come after consonant-roots, to specify their meaning. ""la"" is the sea (a = main, definite...), le is water, re is fire, pa is forest or tree, etc.

But what if you add two vowels? Well, ""lai"" would mean ""marine"" (sea-related), ""lia"" would mean ""the freedom"" (li = free), and ""lua"" would mean lake/river (the one that streams).

Do you see what's interesting? I didn't intend that, but I reversed vowels. i-a-gi means ""of-the-great"", a-i-gi means ""the great one"", while ga-i means ""civilizational"" (ga = civilization, empire), and ""gia"" means ""the greatness"".

Once again, using commas helps. What matters is what comes the closest to the root. If you take ""iagi"", you can write it as i(a(gi)), where a(gi) means the(great), thus i(agi) means connected-to(the-great), ""of-the-great"". Similarly a(igi) = the(great).

But if you take gai and gia, it's the opposite. (ga)i means (civilisation)related, and (gi)a means (great)""main"". Similarly, (la)i means (sea)related, while (li)a means (free)main. And (lu)a means (streaming)main.

# 7) So what

Here is what I take from all of this:

1) Language seems to not want to have meaningful, either differentiating or indifferentiating, commutativity, especially for words close to each other. In other words, when you have two different words, you can generally tell which one comes first.

2) This can be attached to a general idea in language: you want to have prediction/expectiveness to some extent; you don't want to pay attention to every word (to the cost of not grasping the meaning, maybe even getting a totally wrong one), nor to never be able to predict, to some extent, the next word.

1744,0,"Wight-Speech is my very long in the works conlang, intended to be at least fairly naturalistic, but also keeping well in mind the phonaesthetic of things (I am good with sacrificing a little naturalism in return for more cellar doors).

I aim for it to be towards the more agglutinative side of things, using a few affixes for T-A, with modal particles. This will become more fusional/analytic as it evolves further.

It is one of the languages spoken in the accompanying conworld; the wights being among some of the spirits of the otherwise deceased, they still speak the language that they spoke in life, which also happens to be the proto-language of the (yet to be made) modern languages.

***Coronals:***

* dentals (/t⁽ˤ⁾ʰ , t⁽ˤ⁾ , n⁽ˤ⁾ , l⁽ˤ⁾/) are denti-alveolar \[t̪⁽ˤ⁾ʰ , t̪⁽ˤ⁾ , n̪⁽ˤ⁾ , l̪⁽ˤ⁾\].
* alveolars (/s , ɾ/) are true alveolar;
   * /s/ is laminal \[\[s̻\]\].
   * /ɾ/ is apical \[\[ɾ̺\]\].
* the nasal /n/ moves to the PoA of any following stop, nasal, or fricative;
   * =&gt; \[m , (n̪) , n̪ˤ , n , ŋ , ɴ\].
* dark dentals (ones that have not become darkened), can only appear before vowels.

***Gutturals:***

* /ħ/ glottal \[h\] in onsets, and faucal \[χ\~ħ\] in codas, and (onset or coda) clusters.
* /ʕ̞/ is faucal \[ʁ̞\~ʕ̞\].
* /ˤ/ represents faucalisation \~ eg: \[t̪ʶʰ\~t̪ˤʰ , t̪ʶ\~t̪ˤ , n̪ʶ\~n̪ˤ , l̪ʶ\~l̪ˤ\].
   * dentals become faucalised when adjacent to other faucal or faucalised consonants.
* *just to note:* the 'palatovelars' /kʲʰ , kʲ/ are not notated as /c , ɟ/ mainly due to /n/ assimilating to \[ŋ\] before them and not \[ɲ\], and also due to analogy with /k , kʷ/.

***Sonorants:***

* /r/ is apical alveolar tap \[ɾ\].
* nasals and liquids (bar /nˤ , lˤ/) can be syllabic, and used as are the other vowels.
   * syllabic /r̩/ is trilled \[r̩\]
* /j , w , ʕ̞/ are realised as vowels \[i , u , ɑ\] if they can be analysed as being a nucleus (ie: in zero graded words, and in consonantal 'diphthongs').
* sonorants following stops are devoiced if not syllabic.

***Fricatives:***

* The fricatives /s , ħ/, become voiced when preceding -T stops;
   * =&gt; \[z , ʁ\~ʕ\]

**Faucal Harmony:**

1. All coronals, and /m/, within a word, become faucalised when following any faucal or faucalised consonant.
   1. This is unimpeded.
2. All coronals, and /m/, within a word, become faucalised when preceding any faucal or faucalised consonant.
   1. This is blocked by occlusives (ie: all stops and nasals).
   2. Whilst technically blocked by faucal occlusives, they themselves spread the harmony, so act as if there is no block.
3. All vowels preceding the faucal consonant, move towards /a/.
   1. =&gt; i u &gt; e o &gt; a | ɵ &gt; a.
   2. This is unimpeded.
4. All vowels following the faucal consonant, move towards /a/.
   1. This is only applicable in syllables where the onset has been affected by step 1.

Example (psuedoword - Its a bit long; I just wanted to try and show everything in one go):

* /tʰepeːɾɵ**tˤʰ**alep**ʰ**os/ &gt; \[t̪ʰäpäːɾˤät̪ˤʰäl̪ˤäp**ʰ**o̞s\]

***Vowel Quality:***

* mid vowels /e , ɵ , o/ are true mid \[e̞ , ɵ̞ , o̞\].
   * long /eː(ː) , ɵː(ː) , oː(ː)/ are slightly higher than true-mid,
   * short /e , ɵ , o/ are slightly lower than true-mid;

* /a/ is centralised \[ä\~ɐ\].
* /ɑ/ is slightly rounded \[\[ɑ̹\]\].

**Diphthongs:**

|ɾ̩-|ɾi|ɾu|ɾɑ|

* \[ɐ̯\] is more fronted \[\[a̯̽\]\] when following /o/.

**Vowel Length:**

* short vowels and diphthongs are monomoraic,
* long vowels and diphthongs are bimoraic,
* overlong vowels are trimoraic.
* *(thus a length ratio of 1:2:3.)*

# Prosody:

* pitch accent falls on the initial syllable of the root of the head of each phrase.
   * the accent falls on the second mora of polymoraic syllables.
   * pitch accent is a rise in pitch up to the accented mora, followed by a pitch reset on the following mora.
* stress accent falls on the foremost heaviest syllable (syllables with 1, 2, and 3+ morae being light, heavy, and superheavy respectively) within the phrase.
   * stress accent falls on the initial mora of syllables.
   * stressed vowels in open syllables are promoted by +1 mora;
      * =&gt; \[e̞ , ɵ̞ , o̞ , ä\] &gt; \[e̞ː , ɵ̞ː , o̞ː , äː\] &gt; \[e̞ːː , ɵ̞ːː , o̞ːː , äːː\]
      * diphthongs do not count within open syllables as they are seen as ending in a consonant.
* fall in pitch with each minor break
   * pitch resets with a major break

&amp;#x200B;

# Phonotactics:

Syllables are for the most part (C)V(C) ^((CVC is all you need to know, the rest of this section is just me rambling about unfinished ideas, scroll past if you like)), however some consonant clusters are permitted, which along with the longest vowel, makes the max syllable size around CCCVVVCC - something like /skmaːʕ̞st**ʰ**/ \[zkm̥äːːst̪ʰ\] for example;

* Either fricative can precede any stop, liquid, or semivowel in onset position,
   * Exeptions to this are /sr/ and /hʕ̞/ - these are illegal clusters.
   * *note:* as mentioned previously, fricatives voice before -T stops.
* Either fricative can precede any stop in coda position.
   * *note (as previous):* fricatives voice before -T stops.
* Plain velars, and the fricatives, can be followed by any nasal in onset position.

As in PIE, vowels can become zero graded (although this is part of the grammar that I have not 100% figured out yet). This technically allows syllables as small as '∅'.

My current idea around zero grading would be to perhaps have it happen to vowels immediately preceding accented morae. This would allow me to make a derivational form where the accent moves one forward, and zero grades the mora it was previously on, PIE style (eg: témos could become tmós). But currently I'm still playing around with this idea - nothing's solid yet.

Root words (at least once I make some - I've only made two so far *:I*) are monosyllabic, as are affixes and particles. However, there are ways of increasing syllable count; compound words of course can be made.

Also, I'm playing around with an idea I've had for reduplication; my current idea is that the first consonant, and the main element of the nucleus, of a root is made into a prefix, it creates the meaning of whatever the original root was, but in a more abstract perspective.

For example, one of the words I have made is 'brigj' \[pɾ̥ikʲ\], meaning 'tree'. So something like 'brbrigj' \[pr̩pɾ̥ikʲ\] could mean 'lineage' and 'river delta' perhaps.

&amp;#x200B;

So much more to make, but at least I'm fairly happy with the phonology for now.

Some questions I have:

* Would this be convincingly naturalistic? I'm not after mind boggling realism, just enough that it isn't obviously slapped together.
* Is there anything that stands out as odd or difficult that I can iron out?
* Is there anything that I've mentioned that could be expanded upon or fleshed out more?
* I'm also happy to answer any questions you have, providing I do have an answer that is!
* And of course some positive feedback would be welcome if you think I've done anything good...

*Additionally, I most likely have missed at least something out, just tell me if you see anything obviously missing.*

and thanks if you bothered reading this far ! lmao",An Overview of the Phonology and Prosody (and a little Phonotactics and Grammar) of Wight-Speech,"Wight-Speech is my very long in the works conlang, intended to be at least fairly naturalistic, but also keeping well in mind the phonaesthetic of things (I am good with sacrificing a little naturalism in return for more cellar doors).

I aim for it to be towards the more agglutinative side of things, using a few affixes for T-A, with modal particles. This will become more fusional/analytic as it evolves further.

It is one of the languages spoken in the accompanying conworld; the wights being among some of the spirits of the otherwise deceased, they still speak the language that they spoke in life, which also happens to be the proto-language of the (yet to be made) modern languages.

It is a priori as far as the lexicon itself is currently concerned, however **lots** of inspiration has been taken from the Germanic languages, as well as various other Indo-European languages, including PIE, and some Afroasiatic languages.

I found this paper as u/wmblathers posted it, and it seemed very fitting for one of my TyPoWs. We all know about the concept of fractions, but their linguistic expression is rarely talked about. The paper proposes a typology in which there's a distinction between suppletive, non-systematic and analytical, systematic fractional number forms. Now onto the prompts:

* How does your language express fractions?
    * Which categories (those proposed by the paper) does your language's system fall into?
* How does your language express other mathematical concepts such as addition or division?

1763,0,"To start out with, it's worth being aware that a somewhat unusual feature of this phonology is the importance of “whole syllable qualities”: rather than simply having vowels which distinguish roundedness and front vs back, these are features of the syllable as a whole. In order to understand how this works in practice, it is useful to first consider the phonotactics of this language, and how these give rise to certain groupings of the consonants, namely obstruents, liquids, glides, and the nasal. The consonant phonemes fit into these groups as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ypu5c1t4ndh81.png?width=418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee6d9bbf5a37dd88ece2f589508029592e9c0b41

 The letters in brackets will be used to refer to “any phoneme from this set”. In addition, there are a grand total of two phonemic vowels: /a/ and /ə/, the second of which may more accurately described as a null vowel, as we shall see later.

As you may well be aware, a syllable may often be broken down into 3 sections: onset, nucleus and coda.  The onset and coda are quite straightforwardly built with up to one obstruent and one liquid (neither are necessary), as /BL/ in the onset or /LB/ in the coda. The nucleus consists of a vowel, possibly followed by the nasal.

Onset: tick. Nucleus: tick. Coda: tick! Excellent, we can officially construct syllables phonemically, so let’s move on to discussing allophony – and what allophony! – what was that? I though I heard someone say “glides”… Oh! Yes! I said there were glides earlier, didn’t I? What a funny thing to have said…

Anyway, allophony.  The nasal consonant shows perhaps the broadest range of allophony out of all the phonemes of this language.  Not only does it assimilate its place of articulation to be the same as the following consonant, but before a liquid the nasal is reduced to simply nasalising the previous vowel. It’s probably worth noting at this point that /ə/ is barely ever actually pronounced: in any syllable containing a liquid or nasal where the vowel would be /ə/, the nasal/liquid is pronounced as a syllabic consonant, hence the description of a null vowel.  In cases where there are more than one of /n ɹ l/ in a null-vowel syllable, /n/ will be syllabic if present, else the liquid formally in the onset is syllabic.  This also has implications for how some of the glides are realised (yes, ok, I admit it, they do exist. Sort of.), and these are what I shall discuss next.

Whilst I do call them “glides”, this is more a nomenclature of convenience: for the most part, they are not pronounced directly as the phones assigned above, or indeed as distinct sounds at all: moreover, their presence is typically realised primarily through their effects on the rest of the syllable. In a syllable featuring a glide, every single sound may be modified: +BACK glides yield velarised or uvular consonants and back vowels, +FRONT glides yield palatalised or palatal consonants and front vowels, and +ROUND glides yield labialised dorsal consonants and round vowels. A comprehensive set of tables is shown below:

https://preview.redd.it/nfz5wb5lndh81.png?width=625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=248bcb96a95ef7da7c917aa892b3ea7efa4d1b74

There are, however, a handful of instances where the glides do get to be pronounced as separate consonants, namely in otherwise onsetless or codaless syllables, the glide may appear syllable initially or finally, particularly where the vowel is a mid vowel (i.e. \[ɛ ʌ o\], which are allophones of /a/). The high vowels \[i y ʉ u\] may be considered to be syllabic realisations of /j ɥ ʋ w/, which fits nicely with the null vowel description above. As well as this, \[ʋa\] occurs in -FRONT -BACK syllables with /a/ where the preceding consonant is not dorsal.

Finally, there are a few more specific forms of allophony affecting narrower ranges of consonants.

* The sequence of any lateral obstruent followed by /l/ is realised as a geminated lateral obstruent.
* /ɹ/ becomes /ɐ̯/ in coda following a vowel except intervocalically.
* Any sequence of a coronal obstruent (regardless of front/back/neutral) followed by a palatal fricative (across a syllable boundary) becomes an alveolo-palatal consonant, taking voicing from the coronal obstruent but retaining any labialisation from the palatal fricative. Manner of articulation depends on the manner of the coronal obstruent in the following way: plosive -&gt; affricate; fricative -&gt; geminate fricative; affricate -&gt; geminate affricate.

A final phonotactic note of rather limited consequence is that whilst no part of the syllable is individually necessary, there **must** be some form of consonant sound pronounced between vowels in separate syllables, even if it’s just a glide or, in extreme cases, a glottal stop.

So, verbs in this language use combinations of 4 different suffixes and 3 different auxiliaries to convey different meanings. For example:

The word *""vaya:* means ""to be"".

 Attaching the ""tense suffix"" makes it *""vayan""*. 

Then, an auxiliary is used to specify which tense 

*vayan val* - is
*vayan dov* - was
*vayan ik* - will be

If a different suffix is used then the meaning of the auxiliary changes. (modal suffix, aspectual suffix, etc.)

*vayad val* - am being
*vayauro val* - might be
*vaya val* - has to be

The problem that arises from this how to create verb forms such as the future perfect, continuos perfect, etc. 

In terms of tense, I have thought of using the respective tense auxiliary with a certain affix and place it after the main auxiliary to convey things such as future perfect. (*vaya val adov* - had to be).

***Consonants:***

* Nasal Stops: /m̥, m, ŋ͡m, n̪̊, n̪, n̊, n, ɳ̊, ɳ, ɲ̊, ɲ, ŋ̊, ŋ/
* Plain Plosives: /p, k͡p, t̪, t, ʈ, c, k, ʡ, ʔ/
* Aspirated Plosives: /pʰ, t̪^(h), tʰ, ʈʰ, c^(h), k^(h)/
* Prenasalized Plosives: /ᵐp, ^(n̪)t̪, ⁿt, ᶯʈ, ^(ɲ)c, ^(ŋ)k/
* Ejective Plosives: /p’, k͡pʼ, t̪’, t’, ʈ’, c’, k’, ʡ'/
* Plain Affricates: /t̪͡θ, t͡s, ʈ͡ʂ, ʡ͡ʜ, t͡ɬ/ 
* Aspirated Affricates: /t̪͡θ^(h), t͡s^(h), ʈ͡ʂ^(h), t͡ɬ^(h)/
* Prenasalized Affricates: /^(n̪)t̪͡θ, ^(n)t͡s, ^(ɳ)ʈ͡ʂ, ^(n)t͡ɬ/
* Ejective Affricates: /t̪͡θ', t͡s', ʈ͡ʂ', t͡ɬ'/
* Plain Approximates: /β̞, w, ð̞, ɻ, j, ɰ, ʕ̞, ɦ, l̪, l, ɭ, ʎ/		
* Glottalized Approximates: /β̞ˀ, wˀ, ð̞ˀ, ɻˀ, jˀ, ɰˀ, l̪ˀ, lˀ, ɭˀ, ʎˀ/

***Vowels:***		

* Plain Vowels: /i, u, ø, ə, ɚ, o, ʌ, æ, ɑ/
* Nasalized Vowels: /ĩ, ũ, ø̃, ə̃, ə̃˞ , õ, ʌ̃, æ̃, ɑ̃/
* Long Vowels: / iː, uː, øː, oː, ʌː, æː, ɑː/
* Long Nasalized vowels: /ĩː, ũː, ø̃ː, õː, ʌ̃ː, æ̃ː, ɑ̃ː/
* Tones: /˥, ˩˥, ˧, ˥˩, ˩/

***Allophony***

* /ɻ / may be realized as an alveolar approximate
* /ɰ/ may be realized as an uvular approximate
* /k͡p/ may be realized as an implosive
*  Liquids and Glides are nasalized as part of nasal harmony

***Syllable Structure:***

* (L)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(N)
* Onset- All Consonant
* Nucleus- All Vowels
* Coda- All Consonants except Glottal and Glottalized Consonants
* Onset Clusters- Liquid+ Stop + Sonorant
* Coda Cluster- Sonorant + Stop + Nasal
* No Geminate Consonants or Vowel Clusters
* /ʔ/ Separates Two Vowels, /ə/ Separates Illegal Consonant Clusters
* All Vowels are Nasalized after a nasal consonants
* All Vowels become /ɚ/ before /ɻ /

***Stress Rules:***

* Plain Vowel count as 1 Mora, Nasal &amp; Long Vowels count as 2 Mora, Vowels that are both Nasal and Long count as 3 mora
* Syllables with 2 mora are heavy and those with 3 are super heavy
* Stress goes to the heaviest left most syllable or the first syllable of a word without heavy syllables
* Stress is realized as an exaggeration of the vowel's tone, and an increase in loudness; vowels never centralize

***Tone Sandhi:***

* When there are two consecutive mid tones the first one becomes a rising tone
   * When there are three or more mid tones apply the first rule the second to last undergoes Sandhi, then repeat for each remaining series of mid tones
* A low tone becomes a high tone when preceding is a high or rising tone, if the low tone is in a strong suffix

***Vowel Harmony:***

* Front Vowels and Back Vowels cannot co-occur in the same word, with the root vowel causing assimilation in suffixes
* Additionally Back Rounded Vowels and Back Unrounded Vowels Cannot co-occur in the same word
* The Central vowels may co-occur in the same word as all groups of vowels, not blocking assimilation
* Central Vowels in the Root cause vowel assimilation into the front vowel group

***Consonant Harmony:***

* Goes right-to-left, and Affects the root and all Previous Suffixes, causing assimilation
* Dental, Alveolar, and Retroflex Nasals and Plosives cannot co-occur in the same words

***Nasal Harmony:***

* From Left to Right, affecting all suffixes
* Triggered by Stressed Nasal Vowels
* Approximates are allophonically Nasalized
* All Plosives do not nasalize but also do not block assimilation

***Consonant Mutation:***

* Two Types of Suffixes Neutral and Strong
* Strong Suffixes trigger the following consonant to undergo lenition
* Nasals do not undergo lenition
* Ejective Plosives and Affricates Weaken to their plain counterparts
* Approximates weaken by becoming glottalized
* Plain, Aspirated, and prenasalized Plosives and Affricates become a voiced glottal approximate
* Glottalized approximates and the glottal approximate undergo elision",Unnamed (Con)Language of the plains' Phonology,"I intend for this conlang to be the language of a people who live in a enormous grassland, who are often seen as barbarians by the western woodland people and I wanted the language to reflect this by seeming very different from the forest people's and very difficult for somebody of a language like English to learn, I would like any advice to make the phonology seem more naturalistic.

* Nasal Stops: /m̥, m, ŋ͡m, n̪̊, n̪, n̊, n, ɳ̊, ɳ, ɲ̊, ɲ, ŋ̊, ŋ/
* Plain Plosives: /p, k͡p, t̪, t, ʈ, c, k, ʡ, ʔ/
* Aspirated Plosives: /pʰ, t̪^(h), tʰ, ʈʰ, c^(h), k^(h)/
* Prenasalized Plosives: /ᵐp, ^(n̪)t̪, ⁿt, ᶯʈ, ^(ɲ)c, ^(ŋ)k/
* Ejective Plosives: /p’, k͡pʼ, t̪’, t’, ʈ’, c’, k’, ʡ'/
* Plain Affricates: /t̪͡θ, t͡s, ʈ͡ʂ, ʡ͡ʜ, t͡ɬ/ 
* Aspirated Affricates: /t̪͡θ^(h), t͡s^(h), ʈ͡ʂ^(h), t͡ɬ^(h)/
* Prenasalized Affricates: /^(n̪)t̪͡θ, ^(n)t͡s, ^(ɳ)ʈ͡ʂ, ^(n)t͡ɬ/
* Ejective Affricates: /t̪͡θ', t͡s', ʈ͡ʂ', t͡ɬ'/
* Plain Approximates: /β̞, w, ð̞, ɻ, j, ɰ, ʕ̞, ɦ, l̪, l, ɭ, ʎ/		
* Glottalized Approximates: /β̞ˀ, wˀ, ð̞ˀ, ɻˀ, jˀ, ɰˀ, l̪ˀ, lˀ, ɭˀ, ʎˀ/

***Vowels:***		

* Plain Vowels: /i, u, ø, ə, ɚ, o, ʌ, æ, ɑ/
* Nasalized Vowels: /ĩ, ũ, ø̃, ə̃, ə̃˞ , õ, ʌ̃, æ̃, ɑ̃/
* Long Vowels: / iː, uː, øː, oː, ʌː, æː, ɑː/
* Long Nasalized vowels: /ĩː, ũː, ø̃ː, õː, ʌ̃ː, æ̃ː, ɑ̃ː/
* Tones: /˥, ˩˥, ˧, ˥˩, ˩/

***Allophony***

* /ɻ / may be realized as an alveolar approximate
* /ɰ/ may be realized as an uvular approximate
* /k͡p/ may be realized as an implosive
*  Liquids and Glides are nasalized as part of nasal harmony

***Syllable Structure:***

* (L)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(N)
* Onset- All Consonant
* Nucleus- All Vowels
* Coda- All Consonants except Glottal and Glottalized Consonants
* Onset Clusters- Liquid+ Stop + Sonorant
* Coda Cluster- Sonorant + Stop + Nasal
* No Geminate Consonants or Vowel Clusters
* /ʔ/ Separates Two Vowels, /ə/ Separates Illegal Consonant Clusters
* All Vowels are Nasalized after a nasal consonants
* All Vowels become /ɚ/ before /ɻ /

***Stress Rules:***

* Plain Vowel count as 1 Mora, Nasal &amp; Long Vowels count as 2 Mora, Vowels that are both Nasal and Long count as 3 mora
* Syllables with 2 mora are heavy and those with 3 are super heavy
* Stress goes to the heaviest left most syllable or the first syllable of a word without heavy syllables
* Stress is realized as an exaggeration of the vowel's tone, and an increase in loudness; vowels never centralize

***Tone Sandhi:***

* When there are two consecutive mid tones the first one becomes a rising tone
   * When there are three or more mid tones apply the first rule the second to last undergoes Sandhi, then repeat for each remaining series of mid tones
* A low tone becomes a high tone when preceding is a high or rising tone, if the low tone is in a strong suffix

***Vowel Harmony:***

* Front Vowels and Back Vowels cannot co-occur in the same word, with the root vowel causing assimilation in suffixes
* Additionally Back Rounded Vowels and Back Unrounded Vowels Cannot co-occur in the same word
* The Central vowels may co-occur in the same word as all groups of vowels, not blocking assimilation
* Central Vowels in the Root cause vowel assimilation into the front vowel group

***Consonant Harmony:***

* Goes right-to-left, and Affects the root and all Previous Suffixes, causing assimilation
* Dental, Alveolar, and Retroflex Nasals and Plosives cannot co-occur in the same words

***Nasal Harmony:***

* From Left to Right, affecting all suffixes
* Triggered by Stressed Nasal Vowels
* Approximates are allophonically Nasalized
* All Plosives do not nasalize but also do not block assimilation

***Consonant Mutation:***

* Two Types of Suffixes Neutral and Strong
* Strong Suffixes trigger the following consonant to undergo lenition
* Nasals do not undergo lenition
* Ejective Plosives and Affricates Weaken to their plain counterparts
* Approximates weaken by becoming glottalized
* Plain, Aspirated, and prenasalized Plosives and Affricates become a voiced glottal approximate
* Glottalized approximates and the glottal approximate undergo elisionUnnamed (Con)Language of the plains' Phonology",i intend languag peopl live enorm grassland often seen barbarian western woodland peopl i want languag reflect seem differ forest peopl difficult somebodi languag like english learn i would like advic make phonolog seem naturalist conson nasal stop n n n n plain plosiv p k p c k aspir plosiv p h c h k h prenas plosiv p n c k eject plosiv p k p c k plain affric aspir affric h h h h prenas affric n n n eject affric plain approxim w j l l glottal approxim w j l l vowel plain vowel u nasal vowel u long vowel u long nasal vowel u tone allophoni may realiz alveolar approxim may realiz uvular approxim k p may realiz implos liquid glide nasal part nasal harmoni syllabl structur l c c v c c n onset all conson nucleu all vowel coda all conson except glottal glottal conson onset cluster liquid stop sonor coda cluster sonor stop nasal no gemin conson vowel cluster separ two vowel separ illeg conson cluster all vowel nasal nasal conson all vowel becom stress rule plain vowel count mora nasal amp long vowel count mora vowel nasal long count mora syllabl mora heavi super heavi stress goe heaviest left syllabl first syllabl word without heavi syllabl stress realiz exagger vowel tone increas loud vowel never central tone sandhi when two consecut mid tone first one becom rise tone when three mid tone appli first rule second last undergo sandhi repeat remain seri mid tone a low tone becom high tone preced high rise tone low tone strong suffix vowel harmoni front vowel back vowel cannot co occur word root vowel caus assimil suffix addit back round vowel back unround vowel cannot co occur word the central vowel may co occur word group vowel block assimil central vowel root caus vowel assimil front vowel group conson harmoni goe right left affect root previou suffix caus assimil dental alveolar retroflex nasal plosiv cannot co occur word nasal harmoni from left right affect suffix trigger stress nasal vowel approxim allophon nasal all plosiv nasal also block assimil conson mutat two type suffix neutral strong strong suffix trigger follow conson undergo lenit nasal undergo lenit eject plosiv affric weaken plain counterpart approxim weaken becom glottal plain aspir prenas plosiv affric becom voic glottal approxim glottal approxim glottal approxim undergo elisionunnam con languag plain phonolog

  Hello guys.

  Mid-december of last year, a Chinese friend of mine, who works in an anime company in China, contacted me suddenly, asking me if I still knew of Esperanto. I engaged the conversation, intrigued, and she explained that her boss wanted to use that language in their anime, which takes place in a context which evokes of Europe without being exactly Europe.

  *I try not to spoil too much here, she didn't ask me to publicly hide the anime, but she didn't explicitely tell me I could say it.* ***If you manage to guess from some means what anime this is about, please don't spoil to others.***

  So anyway, at that time, it inspired me into taking back that conlang project I had started a few months ago, and that's how r/Hujemi made it into the world. I was discussing with her, she said she would talk to her boss, that he may take hujemi, even though he was more on sth more simple, typically Esperanto.

  But actually I kind of went ahead and astray, I didn't really base myself off the material source on my creating Hujemi, except for a few details, and overall I just let my imagination and my personal conlang project flow. So in the end it was not relevant for them.

# 1) The project

  So today, she contacted me back to say her boss had said it didn't match up, and that he was more on Latin.

  I am thus supposed to translate to Latin if I can. Since I'm already on it, I stay, and will do my best. But then, I'm not so good in Latin, and I will need some help.

  And even though she said her boss had decided his mind, I still ""connect"" to him through her filter, so it's hard to say. Given the context and they seek for in their work, a relex of Latin, or a Latin-based conlang, especially one based on Medieval Latin, would look just as (actually more) on point. And I gotta say I'm more prone to providing help in that way than in doing translations.

  To precise what it's about, the language is going to be used **visually**. It will appear on books, things like that. The anime itself will be dubbed in Chinese (maybe in other languages, I didn't ask about that).

  In any case, I thought it could be interesting to bring that up here. I'll also probably contact other Reddits, except if I get already enough help here. So here is what you can do:

# 2) Participation

  I'm supposed to send her translations by next weekend, in 10 days. What I plan to do is to prepare a document with the texts in English, with Chinese as well when possible (I pass through the details), accompanied by a few options of translations. If you are interested, here is what you can do:

  \- Help me with translating into Latin (or do it by yourself). Ideally Medieval Latin.

*I'm just putting it here, who knows, lol.*

  \- Translate into your own, naturalistic, European languages based, conlang. Better if it's rather Romance-based, or maybe Germanic-based (or both), and I guess Celtic-based could be on point. If it's got Medieval Latin vibes, it's perfect.

*(Note: I am interpreting the aim, she doesn't know exactly what it should be like, and even her boss probably doesn't, they're anime-makers, not conlangers. And since I am not directly in contact with him, plus he's like from a distant country etc., the communication is not immediate)*

  \- Propose samples into a not fully fletched conlang, that would look European in general and (Medieval) Latin in particular. - Once again, the language will appear visually, it will not be spoken.

*I'm probably gonna ask* r/neography *as well.*

&amp;#x200B;

  Whether it be collaborative work, or individual submissions. In any case, contact me by PM.

# 3) Conditions

  I'm helping my friend freely. Because I love languages, I love creating, I'd be glad to see my work in an anime, I'm happy to help my friend. I'm not being used by my friend, I spontaneously offered her to participate to that extent, despite her protesting. And it made me create hujemi, so I'm pretty content with it, no regret.

  Doing it collaboratively was not planned, and it changes things, but I'm going to ask my friend to do it for money. This means that I am not here hiring professionals, nor am I asking you to create a conlang. It's about translating into an already existing conlang that matches with the base (more details on PM), or creating samples of a consistent language (I mean sth that does look like a language, but once again don't create a conlang specifically for it).

  In addition to seeing the samples in the anime, they will probably be mentioned in the specific wiki for the anime (there is one for the manga already).

&amp;#x200B;

  I have like no idea whether that sells or not. You tell me. I can answer questions in comments, although what is too specific and private should be adressed via PM.

With each word, I will also supply the definition (at least, the particular definition I had in mind when choosing it), and its etymology in English to get your gears turning.

1812,0,"Hello! If I have a sound change, for example, like ""a, e, and u + n at the end of a word nasalizes and drops the n"", does that work or is that too specific?

For example, would it instead have to be ""back vowels + nasal consonant nasalizes and drops the consonant""? Or can it be just n, just the end of the word, or just certain specific vowels?

Other than that, I guess more generally speaking, how specific do phonological changes have to be? How do you know what sort of categories of sounds to make? Are there set rules, such as how if you have voiced stops you have to have their unvoiced version as well? I know that's not a ""sound change"" rule but a phonological rule, but I mean, it's analogous. So for example when creating a sound change rule, can you generally just pick one phoneme that changes while keeping the other phonemes in that category the same? 

Thank you!",Question about phonological changes,"Hello! If I have a sound change, for example, like ""a, e, and u + n at the end of a word nasalizes and drops the n"", does that work or is that too specific?

For example, would it instead have to be ""back vowels + nasal consonant nasalizes and drops the consonant""? Or can it be just n, just the end of the word, or just certain specific vowels?

Other than that, I guess more generally speaking, how specific do phonological changes have to be? How do you know what sort of categories of sounds to make?

1819,0,"As conlangers, there's a tendency for us to give precedence to the big monster verbs of languages like Navajo or Abkhaz. Even when we aren't going fully polysynthetic, we often like to go agglutinative in a big way, like Japanese or Turkish. When this happens there's a tendency for nouns to get left behind. We might venture to mark possession, or give them some cases and a few classes, but where our verbs might have several thousand forms and be considered decent sized, our nouns may have a hundred and be considered absurd. I intend here to redress the situation by proposing a structure for the most absurdly polysynthetic noun wherewith I could come up. I am not going to propose any particular phonetic forms, nor will I describe except in a few cases the diachronics of any categories. I will admit that two of these categories were borrowed from Ithkuil, but I don't think that it would be impossible to justify them within a natural language (though difficult).

The first category I would mark is quantity. This contains number (singular, dual, plural etc.), but also values such as 'a few', 'more', 'most', 'all', 'another', 'only', etc.. All of these would relate to the number of the noun, but also place it in context.

The second (one borrowed from Ithkuil) is configuration. Typically only of non-singulars, this category has three binary axes (so perhaps it might be better divided into three categories, oh well). The category contains: are all members of this group essentially identical or are they varying, are they well organised or are they randomly arranged, and are they then fused or interconnected together into a single emergent entity. This category builds on the more literal aspect of number by describing in what sense the object is to be treated as a single group.

The third category I've landed on is also borrowed from Ithkuil, and is called affiliation. It describes in what sense components of a group are acting together. There is the consolidative, which describe where the objects are naturally affiliated to no particular purpose, such as the branches of a tree, or grains of sand on a beach. Then there is the associative, where all members of the group are put together to a common aim, such as an orchard of trees (as opposed to a grove), or a platoon of soldiers. The variative describes a group where members differ in their function (although are not necessarily at odds), such as a jumble of tools, a mess of notes, or a rag-tag group of people. Finally in this category is the coalescent, where the members of a group take different roles, but which complement each other. Examples might be a team of rugby players, a pair of wings, or a well balanced meal (of pieces of food).

Hopefully we can get back to some shorter categories now. Definiteness takes four values here. Definite and indefinite, as well as a generic are present, similar to though probably different from those in english. A notable addition is what I will call the semi-definite, which is a category in St̓át̓imcets, (though that language does not have a definite as in english, so there it is simply called definite) which is where the object is definite in the mind of the speaker, but not necessarily the listener.

Next, deixis. I have chosen a five part system which represent (because I can't remember the appropriate words) 'which', 'this one over here', 'that one over there', 'this one here' &amp; 'that one there'.

Stance is one of the ones where I don't know if it's represented in a natlang, but it doesn't seem unlikely in the grand scheme of things. It represents whether the objects are standing, walking along, sitting, or lying down. This is typically of human nouns, but there would be metaphorical extension, as with all of these categories.

Noun class it a fairly simple one. I'd have maybe four or five classes. Something like human, animate, inanimate edible, inanimate.

Case is an important one. The cases are nominative, accusative, genitive, allative, locative, ablative, perlative (along), orientative (pointed towards), instrumental, and considerative (the source of my evidence being).

You may notice that while substantial, this is far from absurd (excepting maybe the considerative, which is certainly uncommon). This is remedied however by subcase. This will be the only time I will mention diachronics. I imagine that this would evolve from the incorporation of body parts into the noun, at first as adpositions with locative cases, and later with other cases. I shan't enumerate them, but suffice to say that with locative cases they would add a fairly consistent spatial relation (such as on top or to the side), but with other cases they represent something far less obvious. For example, the subcase of the instrumental might represent the method by which the noun is used. With the considerative it might represent by what means the evidence was gathered (whether say by sight, hearing, hearsay or others). With the genitive it might determine the nature of possession, whether that might be kinship, creator-creation, part-whole or some other relation. With the nominative and accusative it might add subtle shades of volition, agency and affectedness, so that, for example, while there may be no dative, all manner of indirect objects might be distinguished.

Now. I don't propose that such a noun might exist in the wild. I would however like to argue that this might demonstrate that a noun needn't be treated as so obviously subordinate to the verb.

Hello, I’m looking forward to create a “island-language” and to give it this vibe I’m taking heavy Polynesian phonetical influence, but I’m trying also to not keep it too basic. I thought about Bantu noun-classes for its nouns, but was already working with a 4-degree animacy ladder (animi, automati, corporis, operis). I thought merging the two could be interesting, but was not sure if it sounded natural and couldn’t find an ANADEW.

My thought was letting the two systems compete, I’ve taken out one step of animacy, leaving it with animi (animate), corporis (things that exist by itself on the natural world), operis (things that are products, specially human-related products). The animi nouns could only be of the “animate” class, but the corporis and operis nouns could be of any of 7 classes. That is, there’s the class of “particulates”, there could be an operis particulate (“kapala” – “sawdust”), but also a corporis particulate (“kapu” – “sand”).

My idea was using the animacy to determine: articles, non-tonic subjective pronouns (~~they work more or less as an particle to indicate that the anterior term is the subject~~), adjective, numbers \[and things that come together with the noun in general\] and use the class to determine “referentials” (pronouns), tonic pronouns and numeric pronouns \[and things that substitute the noun in general\]. 

I thought this evolving in a language that already had an animacy ladder, but incorporated “referential words” in the noun paradigm. As in the beginning it would have been more: “the vase is on the table, take *the recipient* ” and then “the recipient” being simplified to ““recipient”” and understood as the class indicator of vase and so its correspondent pronouns and spreading to other kind of pronouns.

Also, the morphology is very analytical, I don't know if it matters that much, but it is good to keep in mind all this ""agreement"" is ocurring between individual words and not inflecional morphology upon pronouns/nouns/articles.

Would it be passable or natural or is it just confusing? Also, should I let some “substituting pronouns” with some rests of animacy marking to make the path more clear?

P.S.: the classes:

* Particulate: whole bodies, things that are made out of just one material, powders and granulate materials in general (sand, gravel, sawdust, etc.), concepts understood as an indivisible whole.
* Fluid: liquids, fire, wind (and variations), flexible objects.
* Immobile: “fix” things, things that usually aren’t moved (houses, structures, cities), some body parts, geographical accidents “characterized by the presence of a thing” \[mountain is immobile, but bay is not\].
* Immaterial: things that are impossible to take by hand, atmospheric phenomena, general actions, languages.
* Recipient: recipients (vases, bowls, etc.), “things” that have the shape of recipients (bay), storage spaces.
* Conjunct: concepts and words that refer to more than one being even in the singular \[not the same as a collective number since it’s not productive\] (ex.: Palano’ — vegetation).
* Edible and plant: edibles and plants (and also some products of plants, as fibers, wood, etc.).","[Is this feature naturalistic?] Merging two noun classes systems (animacy and ""shape"" systems) in the nouns of a conlang","

*1. Terréän doesn't generally compare complexion to flower colors, so I went with a combination at once more figurative and less: ""lily white"" becomes ""nervous"" (i.e. pale with anxiety), while ""poppy red"" becomes ""blushing"" (e.g. red with embarrassment or shame, which is a feeling I got from both the original lyric and the performance).*

*2,3. The wording here is somewhat ambiguous. To ""lay someone out"" can mean to knock them down, to strike them unconscious, to present them as on a display, to arrange them in a sleeping position… Similarly, ""to go down"" also has various meanings in English. I chose to interpret these lines as the speaker being prepared for burial.*

*4. The ""You will"" in this line is the modal verb* mírë*, ""must, shall, will,"" which denotes the inevitability of an action or outcome. The sun* ***will*** *rise, two plus two* ***will*** *equal four, and the speaker* ***will*** *not awake from the sleep of death, no matter what dreams may come.*

5*. The idiom ""you've made your bed, and now you must lie in it"" doesn't keep its meaning when translated literally, so I used ""caught on your own fish hook"" instead.*

Close my eyes, and disappear

You won't feel a thing, he said, when you go down

Nothing gonna wake you now

Of flowers, soft beneath my heels

Walking in the sun

I remember someone

So for some weird reasons I decided to translate Sally Yeh's *珍重 Treasure*. 

But by that I don't mean just a literal translation with no constraint. I meant that I decided *to render it in hujemi with the exact same versification, including the same rhyme in ""ei""*. This obviously uses the nature of hujemi that permits such an exercise. Now, obviously, the risk is to sacrifice to it the good-sounding, but I tried to keep it fair in that regard, as much as possible.

It was used in the movie Mountains May Depart.

I say lucky, because you are going to discover a new great song. I really like its flow, its emotions... And the lyrics are great as well (I just regret that they went for the quite lame repeating the same verse) (I'm sending them in traditional):

 突然地沉默了的空氣  
停在途上令人又再回望你  
沾濕雙眼漸紅  難藏熱暖及痛悲  
多年情 不知怎說起

  
在何地仍熱切關心你  
無盡長夜為陪伴我懷念你  
他方天氣漸涼  前途或有白雪飛  
假如能 不想別離你

  
不肯 不可 不忍 不捨  失去你  
盼望世事總可有轉機  
牽手 握手 分手 揮手  講再見  
縱在兩地一生也等你

I will give my translation first, with gloss and translation-to-English, then will do the same for the lyrics in Chinese themselves. You can read in whatever order you like.

# 0) Preliminary notes

The best part in the song, to me, which is also the biggest challenge, resides in these two lines:

""不肯 不可 不忍 不捨  失去你"" and ""牽手 握手 分手 揮手  講再見"". It both sounds great, so condensed, vivid, in Chinese, with the repetition that works well, and I love the way it insists on the first line, and gradually evolves in the other line. The imagery of these two hands that hold, shake, part, and wave, is really vivid and meaningful, and it's very hard to render it in another language, even though I realized it worked pretty fair in English.

In hujemi, the first one, with the 不, is doable, but the second one is simply not, so I had to create another imagery. I chose one which is a bit more abstract, of a perception that arises and vanishes. While reading that part in my poem and translation, you can notice that the movement is quite different: while in Chinese it only directs at the separation, in my hujemi version the perception appears, contacts, and curl-up, only to eventually suddenly disappear at the 4th and very last occurrence. It thus conveys an idea of suddenry, of chance, which is not without a connexion with the song, especially the very first words 突然地. Also, the full line is thus a bit different: it's not only about the past, but also about the present and the way feelings and memories arise and vanish. If that's clear.

The title of the song is ""treasure 珍重 "". I would render it as ""be"" or ""bei"" (not exactly sure). Which actually connects with my translation.

The song always ends with either 你 nei, or with sth ending in ei. I wanted to keep that rhyme. But ""you"" is ""ab"". That being said, hujemi's pronoun system is quite loose, and there is no clear distinction between pronoun and definite-noun. So I used ""abei"" as ""you"". It means literally DEF-precious, and it includes ""ab"" (you). To keep the meaning of ""you"", I wrote it in linear, not in block.

A last note. The rythm in the song is as follow, as I get it:

3-2-1\_\_ 3  
3-2-2 4  
3-3  \_\_  3-4  
3 \_\_ 5

bis

1-2-2-2-1 3  
3-1-2-3  
1-2-2-2-1 3  
3-1-2-3

I tried to follow that rythm, not having discrepancies in the phrases' decomposition. If that's clear...

So many years, I don't know how to express...

*The choice of words, throughout the lyrics, to me, is excellent.*

An endless eternal night seems to follow me recalling you\*  
Somewhere else, the atmosphere gradually cools down\*; there may even fall (fly) snow  
Even if I can, I (just) don't want to leave you

*\*: That's the way I understand this line.*

\* : If you didn't notice, please do, that the cooling-down echoes the fire and ardent feelings that also appear in the verse. In the last verse, in the place where ""漸涼"" (become cold) stands, there was 漸紅 (become red), which evokes sort-of the opposite.

*\*: ""jo-r"" lit. ""perception/mood-""R"". ""jo"" plus a consonant can mean many things, depending on the context, including a colour. But it's less definite, so it can also connects to fire etc., which is neat - even though I mainly chose it to use one less syllable (instead of jesro).*

*I like the way I rendered the eyes becoming wet up-to red.*

*\*\*: lit. ""magmatic"". Even though hujemi is synesthetic and it doesn't necessarily mean lit. she's magma-hot, still I wouldn't say that's my best idea in the translation. But I couldn't find better.*

*\*\*\* : This line/phrase is a bit confuse, to render the way she feels (and also because I couldn't manage to phrase it correctly, but then I realized it was fortunate).*

Suddenly (in) a silent atmosphere  
Stopping on my way, I start thinking back to you  
Both eyes wet and become\* red; hiding the fever, the heat becomes pain  
So many years, I don't know how to express...

*\* : ""become"" = 漸, which has the notion of ""gradually"". It also contains the key of water, and could be read as ""flow into"".*

*The choice of words, throughout the lyrics, to me, is excellent.*

     在 何-地      仍     熱切     關心                          你
    at any-place remain ardent caring-for(lit. guard-heart)   you
  無盡        長夜        為              陪伴  我  懷念      你
    endless eternal-night do/become/seem   follow  1  recall   you

    other-place  atmosphere become-cold  future  may have  snow fly
假如-能           不-想-       別離    你
    even-if-(I)can   don't-want  leave  you

Whatever the place, remains my ardent caring for you  
An endless eternal night seems to follow me recalling you\*  
Somewhere else, the atmosphere gradually cools down\*; there may even fall (fly) snow  
Even if I can, I (just) don't want to leave you

*\*: That's the way I understand this line.*

\* : If you didn't notice, please do, that the cooling-down echoes the fire and ardent feelings that also appear in the verse. In the last verse, in the place where ""漸涼"" (become cold) stands, there was 漸紅 (become red), which evokes sort-of the opposite. 

       不-肯           不-可      不-忍         不-捨        失去     你
    don't-accept   don't-can  don't-bear   don't-give-up  losing  you

Hopefully human-affairs can always turn-for-the-better  
Hold hands, shake hands, part hands, wave hands, say goodbye

I am curious about what is going to become of the world later, having in mind what's happening now a day.

So... I remembered that Odin had gone to see the Norns, in Yggdrasil, and they told him to go see Mimir. After giving one of his eyes to him in exchange for drinking water from the pool of wisdom he began to see absolutely everything, including the Ragnarök, in a matter of seconds.

He understood that to get more knowledge he had to suffer more than ever, so he stuck his weapon in one of his ribs and hung from a branch for 9 days. It was there while enduring all the paint that he found out the runes, which could show everything.

Long story short, I've recently been diagnosed with a hand strain injury from overworking and can't use my hand for most of the day. This post is probably the only one I'll be able to make today.

This got me thinking about making a language for my worldbuilding project that is easily usable for people with low dexterity, through the use of keyboards or computers with a limited amount of buttons that are easily hit. My original idea for this came after looking at the Razer Tartarus one-handed keyboard. It has around 20 keys. 16 if you use keys for ctrl, shift, alt and space. I was thinking of using the top row for numbers, so that leaves me 11 keys for letters. Ideally, it still uses elements of the modern Roman alphabet, so I could actually use it on a keyboard.

My questions are, what are the most important concepts I should consider when making a language like this to make usage viable still? Is it viable to ""trim the fat"" out of the Roman alphabet to make it fit this idea?

After half a year of announcing the works of this and a very slow development here it is the first alpha release of Polyglot for android :)  

As a first note, I've only tested this in just a couple of devices I have. Android screen sizes and features are quite overwhelming, so I'm counting on your guys help to find some of the compatibility issues among devices.  

Polyglot needs Android 9 Pie or greater, if you have an older device please let me know to check what can be done (but no promises here)  


This is a slow start, I've only worked on the lexicon screen and there's still work to do to properly match the desktop app.

In fact, in all of the languages given they rhyme, so why don't they in Skjeriskʀ?  If we look at the Proto-Germanic forms: \*mazgaz &lt; \*mazgą, and \*dwergaz, we can see that Skjeriskʀ /ʒ/ corresponds to \*z in proto-germanic (the /i/ is an unrelated phenominon to do with the way the other forms of mergr palatalised to have /j/, and then that getting analogised and syllabified in the nominative, a similar phenomenon affects all other historic velars).

Wow that's pretty similar!  I should probably mention that Skjeriskʀ was derived from old norse but with where ""r"" derived from \*z written differently.  This was a result of Old East Norse preserving the destinction as shown by the rune ᛦ in inscriptions, and the dialect that gave rise to Skjeriskʀ had shared in the west's diphthong innovations, but retained east norse ""ʀ"" as it was spelled (including keeping the spelling to represent the sound it ended up as), and then merging it with the palatalisation of old norse \[g\], giving ""Frigg"" as ""Friʀ"" (/friʒ/), as a result of analogy putting the palatalised form in the nominative (leading to P-GMC \*jj becoming /ʒ/ in most positions).",Comparison of my Skjeriskʀ and various other languages.,"Skjeriskʀ \[ʃerɪʃ\] is a small North Germanic ConLanguage spoken on a rock in the Norwegian Sea.

The c is used for &lt;ts&gt; at the beginning of words, but ts is used otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

**Phonotactics:** 

The syllable structure is (C) (C) V (C) (C), but it's mostly a (C) V (C).

Only a few consonant clusters are allowed in the onset or coda. These being, for the onset, plosives+r; plosives+fricatives (from f to z) and /kh/; fricatives (f to z) + n/r; and nasals+r. For the coda clusters we can have r+nasals; m+s; and n+s/z/x.

&amp;#x200B;

Ignoring clusters, any consonant can be in the onset. The nucleus can be made from any vowel. The coda excludes /dzh/; m; p; and /zh/ from it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's SOV, and mostly postpositional. The relative clauses change to SVO.

&amp;#x200B;

***Grammar:*** 

Nouns are always capitalized.

&amp;#x200B;

There are 3 genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter. Masculine nouns end in -o or -u; the vowel can be followed by any consonant. Feminine nouns are divided between -e and -i endings. Neuter are defined by the -a.

&amp;#x200B;

Number: 

The singular is unmarked. The plural is made by adding -r/- ēr (if masculine or a -e ending feminine word), or -n/ īn (if neuter or a -i ending feminine word).

I'm at the beginning stages of constructing two conlangs that exist in the same world. I thought I'd make them naming languages, but then I wondered, what naming conventions should I use? I'd like to hear how you decided what patterns or limits to use in the morphology and syntax of transparent names in your conlang.

I wrote this sketch of place names in English in increasing morphological/syntactic complexity, if it helps explain what I mean.

These are more or less the options I'm aware of, but I'm sure I'm missing possibilities! How complex are your transparent names—strictly limited, or generally elaborate? If they're elaborate, what conventions did you pick and why?

Did a natural language(s)'s naming system influence your conlang? Or did you invent one unlike anything found in a known natlang? What do you like about your decision?

While I am currently most preoccupied with toponyms, I'd like to hear about anything you might describe as a transparent naming practice—so, transparent personal names, transparent descriptions of taboo words, etc.

Singular plural-forms are used when you're reffering to something that has 1 body but multiple natures (e.g. mind; like in schizophrenia) &amp; plural singular-forms are used when you're reffering to something that has 1 nature and multiple bodies (like e.g. all of ""yous"" from alt. dimension/reality/timeline)!&lt;How does your conlang deal with LGBTetc. pronouns and grammatical gender?",although human peopl fellow post soviet countrypeopl alien peopl user hate unawar exist tran agend etc yet somehow one total use kind peopl friendli gt yeah learn end hate tran lt back gramat gender masculin feminin neuter but i ven idea distinguish masc amp neut idea make neut noun end vowel othar masc noun end vowel i got rid neut gender few year ago i decid masc longer masc non fem throughout venrelux star trek refer intend approarch differ speci luzhak alien third gender gt say non binari hell lt amp wanda alien absolutli gender as emper n use auxlang amongst cev member luzhak third gender need use non fem form amp wanda abl choos one sinc abl bear children cours would reproduc otherwis sinc gender chromosom ren girl it sometim hard keep correct gender talk emper n fun fact gt singular emper n e also singular plural etc mean someth els singular plural form use reffer someth bodi multipl natur e g mind like schizophrenia amp plural singular form use reffer someth natur multipl bodi like e g you alt dimens realiti timelin lt how deal lgbtetc pronoun grammat gender

I was seek of COVID most of last year. I'm still on oxygen. I work from bed to finish the Maj language. My goal is to translate  about 5000 words up to the end of this year and make the first release.  

Maj is a minimalist language designed for efficient chat and games. It has very short words and is based on simple and logic reading rules. We use Latin alphabet with small modifications. 

**Alphabet:**

Maj has an alphabet derived from ISO Latin. It has 26 letters associated with 29 distinctive sounds: 

* 7 vowels: { a, e, i, o, u, y, h}. 
* 18 consonants: {b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, x, z} 
* 4 digraphs: {tc, ts, dj, gn}.  
* 2 Latin letters: {q, w} are not used in Maj.

**Modified letters:**

1. Letter ""c"" is read /ʃ/ similar to ""sh"" in word ""sheep"";
2. Letter ""j"" is read /ʒ/ that sounds like ""j"" in word ""jello""
3. Letter ""y"" is read /ɘ/ similar to ""eo"" in word ""pigeon"";
4. Letter ""z"" is read /z/ similar to ""z"" in word ""zebra"";
5. Letter ""h"" is polymorphic. It represents two distinctive sounds;
   1. after a vowel or at beginning of words  is read  /h/ in word ""hot"";
   2. after any  consonant is read /ə/ similar to letter  ""u"" in word: ""pleasure""

**Maj Digraphs:**

1. Cluster ""tc""  is read /t͡ʃ/ and is similar to digraph ""ch"" used in word ""peach"";
2. Cluster ""ts"" is read /t͡s/ similar to group ""zz"" in word: ""pizza"";
3. Cluster ""dj"" is read /d͡ʒ/ similar to ""gi"" in word: ""giraffe"";
4. Cluster ""gn"" is read /ŋ/ similar to Italian group gn in word ""signore""

1861,0,"This is a game of borrowing and loaning words! To give our conlangs a more naturalistic flair, this game can help us get realistic loans into our language by giving us an artificial-ish ""world"" to pull words from!

The Telephone Game will be posted every Monday and Friday, hopefully. 

### Rules

1) Post a word in your language, with IPA and a definition.

Note: try to show your word inflected, as it would appear in a typical sentence. This can be the source of many interesting borrowings in natlangs (like how so many Arabic words were borrowed with the definite article fossilized onto it! algebra, alcohol, etc.)

2) Respond to a post by adapting the word to your language's phonology, and consider shifting the meaning of the word a bit!

3) Sometimes, you may see an interesting phrase or construction in a language. Instead of adopting the word as a loan word, you are welcome to **calque** the phrase -- for example, taking *skyscraper* by using your language's native words for *sky* and *scraper*. If you do this, please label the post at the start as **Calque** so people don't get confused about your path of adopting/loaning.

1862,0,"I have described my language as being SVO however it uses subject and object in a way I don't think is that common.  The ""Subject"" is always the thing that carrying out the action and the ""Object"" is always the thing that the action is being carried out on.  An example of how this (using glosses) works.

""I talked to you"" would be translated to \[1st.Person.Pron\] \[communicate\] \[2nd.Person.Pron\]

""I talked"" would be translated to \[1st.Person.Pron\] \[communicate\]

But

""You listened"" would be translated to \[communicate\] \[2nd.Person.Pron\].

Likewise something like ""I received"" would be translated to \[transfer-item\] \[1st.Person.Pron\],

&amp;#x200B;

Also sometimes my language's idea of what a subject and object are just don't correspond to other languages.  For example  ""I went inside of the house"" would be translated as \[House\] \[eat\] \[1st.Person.Pron\].

Voice of the magic flute flowing

Luster of the jade white urn turning

All night the fishes and the dragons danced

*""kriv"" is one of the ways to express ""power, strength"", I think the most relevant here.*

1866,0,"Do any of your conlangs have system method of differentiating profane, colloquial, and formal speech from each other, aside from simply saying “X-word is profane?”

For example, many, if not most, profane words in English have Germanic origins since the first users of those words spoke Ænglisc (the amalgamation of languages that made up Old English). What’s interesting, however, is that more sophisticated/refined vocabulary tends to have French roots (house vs mansion [from the French word “maison” meaning house],  cow -&gt; beef [from the French word “cow” bœf,] pig -&gt; pork [from the French word “porc”]). This was largely due to the fact that, during the early Middle Ages, most of the nobility in England spoke French (Old Norman?) thanks to the Norman invasion of 1066, as such, as the Old English merged with Norman (Old French?) to create Middle English, this social hierarchy created a vocabulary hierarchy within English. Likewise, during the Renaissance and Enlightenment, there was a large injection of Latin and Greek into English, particularly within the scientific community. As such, much of English’s scientific vocabulary still uses Latin and Greek vocabulary, perhaps most notably in the field of medicine. 

As such, field-specific terminology and writing styles aside, reading an article from a tabloid reads much differently from reading an article from, say National Geographic Magazine or the New Yorker, with the latter group having more “5 dollar words” than the former.

1867,0,"So, basically, I've been wrangling a future (\~400 years) English conlang for a while now. This current iteration of it is called Severn, and its distinguishing feature is how the southern drawl is reflected in how things are spelled.

Orthography is pretty important because this is for a book and I want to pull off a sort of magic trick where the average English-speaking reader will sound out any given name, and it'll sound like the modern day name, but with a heavy southern drawl. I.E., Babble = Bible, Severn = Southern, Tayaxas = Texas. I'm aware that this probably isn't how a future English would *really* shake out orthographically, I just want the reader to sound it out right. The main sound changes:

* ɑ, ɔ &gt; ɑ
* ʌ &gt; ɛ
* æ &gt; ɛjə
* aɪ &gt; a
* aʊ &gt; ejo
* ɛ &gt; ejə
* eɪ &gt; ɛ 
* i &gt; ɪ
* ɪ &gt; ijə
* ɔɪ &gt; ɑj
* oʊ &gt; ɛʊ
* u &gt; ʉ
* ʊ &gt; ʊ

Two problems I have: one, some words just look kind of stupid, particularly where drawling is involved. Is this what being disappointed in your own child feels like? It might just be that my brain is registering the words as misspelled English. Is that normal for a future English conlang, or is Severn just not different enough?

The second is a minor gripe I have with a sound change I really want to keep, but for the life of me I'm having trouble writing it out. It's i &gt; ɪ at the end of words. Take ""friendly,"" for example, pronounced /frɪnlɪ/ in Severn.

* frinli: looks different enough, but the reader would probably still read it as /frɪnli/.
* frinlih: sounds out in the intended way, but I hate it. It gives off ""clunky phonetic transcription you get when you type 'how to pronounce friendly' into Google"" vibes.
* frinlit: okay, this is a weird one. Basically, a lot of English speakers don't pronounce /t/ super strongly, so I'm trying to exploit that, but I don't know how effective it actually is.

This got kind of rambling, but basically, I want to hear thoughts about future English orthographies/opinions on the lowered /i/ problem I detailed above.

1872,0,"# Phonotactics and other tactics in hujemi

  **0) A general note**

  It's really important to understand that hujemi is an open language, which is not meant to be fully, perfectly, neatly completed, in a way that all you would have to do would be to learn it and use it. The speakers, if (hopefully) there are, will adopt and adapt the language, and this is not only expected but hoped for.

  Of course, there are limits to the way the language can be adapted - at some point it would become changing it into a different language -, but most of the possible adaptations are possible and welcome, typically ""defining"" words, crafting phrases, choosing a personal word order (or even suggesting new syntax guidelines), suggest reinterpretations of some base syllables, propose changes to the glyphs' design (especially the ones I feel are not very neat, like the B), etc.

  What needs to remain is the spirit/concept of the language, and, for the most, the meaning of the glyphs and base syllables. The spirit/concept of the language may be expressed as such:

  1) Every ""phoneme"" (including bi-consonants) is attributed a glyph and a meaning. The glyph represents the idea that it means, in a symbolic way.

  2) Vowels have a rather grammatical role, and can be used as kindof case markers, at the beginning of words, or as a precising the meaning/use of a root, after a consonant.

  3) The collection of glyphs intends at being not exagerately long, so as to not use too close or/and difficult phonemes (or clusters), nor too small, so as to not suffice to render enough meanings, at least in small enough words.

  4) The association of glyphs, meanings, and phonemes, intends to be the most intuitive possible, from intuitive synesthetic principles (l sounds fluid, k sounds more cut and hard) and a sample of languages (namely Chinese, Romance, Germanic - I wish I could have based myself upon more languages, but these are the ones I could use). The association of meanings follows a synesthetic spirit. With ""ftu"" for instance meaning ""to stand"", from ""ft"" meaning ""mountain"".

  5) (as a recap) The language tries to express much with little, by combining intuitive element glyph-roots-phonemes.

&amp;#x200B;

  Now, something that needs to be emphasized is how I myself thus somewhat ""discover"" the language while ""crafting it"" and using it. The options for word orders or for grammatical words made of vowels for instance where deduced from my base principles.

  The following sentence perfectly expresses the way I feel it:

***""Ho visto un angelo nel marmo ed ho scolpito fino a liberarlo.""***  
(Michelangelo Buonarroti) ""I saw an angel within the marble and I sculpted in order to liberate it.""

To which I would add this forever quote:  ***為而不恃，功成而弗居。夫唯弗居，是以不去。***""He acts and doesn't lean, completes and doesn't stay; for he doesn't stay, his work will remain""

  

*So it's really crucial you understand the following are not rules for the language (except to a little extent the 1) ), but only tactics that can be used to appropriate the language.*

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Phonotactics**

  The pronunciation of the glyphs are indicated at the bottom of part 2. I intended them to be sufficiently distinct and pronouncable. This is the reason for the weird (d)V. I added this (d) to make the V distinct from the F, modeling after the (d)J vs Sh and (d)Z vs S which use the same tactics.

  The limits I set on phonotactics, to avoid overly big consonant clusters, were that a syllable should only accept one ending consonant. To avoid vowel clusters, I put that u and i should be consonantized into w and j (""y"") when needed - and it should be expected when used within a syllable. The diphtongue ""ao"" should also be pronounced as such, even though it's ok to make it two vowels.

  That being said, this still admits for up to 4-consonants clusters, when both the consonant ending of a syllable and the initial of the next one are a biconsonant. Technically speaking, the maximum is even 6, taking into account the semi-vowels. E.g. ""jaistklia"" /dʒa**jstklj**a, which could be understood as ""artistic-neat-the-cold"".

  There are several ways to keep hujemi pronouncable, which are the following:

  1) Since you construct your words yourself, just *avoid* putting too many consonants in a row, or putting together ones that are hard to pronounce together, or which are the same and hard to double. There are many ways to express the same ideas anyway. For instance, instead of saying ""joklna"" to mean ""moon-white"", you can use the longer form of ""colour"" which is ""jes"", thus saying: jesklona, or, if ""skl"" is still too much (or if you want to avoid the confusion with sk.l), you can add an ""e"": jeseklona, since ""jese"" is the same as jes; or you can simply rule out the ""klo"" altogether and write ""jesna"", ""moon-coloured"".

  2) As I did en passant in this 1st paragraph, you can add a vowel inside a cluster to help the pronunciation. When a specific vowel is relevant because that's the meaning of the consonant that you're using, use it; otherwise, you can just go with ""o"", which is fairly meaningless on its own. E.g.: puk.re, ""I changed into fire"" (to avoid the confusion with pu.kre, ""I grow-metal"") --&gt; pukire (grow-different-fire). puf.da, ""I grew"" - into a man, an adult (to avoid the confusion with pu.fta, ""grow-mountain) --&gt; pufoda

  3) Using this systematically, one might even make hujemi a virtually vowel-consonant-harmonic language. That is, with 2 exceptions - the semi-vowels and the bi-consonants. For the semi-vowels, you generally can avoid them inside a syllable, or find solutions, or even you can actually consider such clusters are really nothing too difficult. However, the bi-consonants may indeed look arbitrary and not so easy to pronounce. To help with it, using an ""o"" is somewhat possible, but it's not as harmless as doing such after an ending consonant, because the bi-consonant is supposed to keep together, and means as such. What I thus recommend is using either a very close o (as opposed to a broad ɔ), or, even better, *using the secret 7th vowel, y, which can be pronounced as either an /y or an /ø*. That vowel is used for loanwords, when it's better to use that sound instead of a close one, but you can use it within a difficult biconsonant. **Remember to not stress that vowel**.

**2) Esthetactics**

  Hujemi is not conceived to be esthetic, I mean to be good-sounding, and it only partially aims at being good-looking (with its script). The very (oligosynthetic) principles that it follows induce that.

  That being said, using the potential of hujemi, and the way a given idea or phrase can be expressed in many different ways, it is adviced to try to adapt one's words and phrases so as to help its pronunciation and even its phonological esthetics.

  Adapting one's speech can even be done using special ad hoc rules, including ones that could be used in other languages - but also ones that are only possible in hujemi (or similar oligosynthetic languages). It is thus encouraged for practicers of hujemi, both to practice/learn the language but also to actually help it in its development, to try and translate, and even compose (versify), poetry, or even songs, in hujemi. I may be a bit ambitious and megalo in this, but I really wish this could happen. At least, that's what the language dreams of, and the way it would be fully completed.

  Apart from versification, one may even use phonologic tactics which are special to hujemi. I especially think of going full vowel-consonant-harmonic, as mentioned above, in a way similar to Japanese. This ofc doesn't need to be always the case, but it can be a fine exercise from times.

  **3) Aerial speech - fujofi**

  In a similar way, among other ""tactics"" or ""games"" to ""play"", is aerial speech, which I define as using chiefly or only ""up"" consonants. This can be done by only using such consonants as first syllables' initial, or as initials period, or even as the only consonants used. You can also consider using exclusively ""top"" and ""left"" consonants, that is, just reject the ""down"" consonants.

  Reversely, you might try doing the same with the ""bottom"" consonants. I am just not sure of a word to label that - earth speech? down speech?

  This ofc would be a bad way of using the language if used systematically (and a weird one as well), and it actually contradicts the principle of combining different roots - roots mean through their combination, not just their single presence. That being said, it can be a nice occasional exercise to try, and it can also be used in a poem or sth to express an idea of abstractness, of superiority, etc. - reversely, the ""down speech"" would express humbleness.

  **4) Small-speech - fujoci**

  Small-speak is using just a few words/sounds to express much. It's similar to Japanese haikus and Chinese chengyus. A way to do that is thus to write haikus or chengyus, but ofc this requires some adaptation into hujemi.

  What is a haiku?

  A haiku is a type of poems used in Japan. It's actually a shortened tanka. A tanka is made of 5 lines/verses, which use respectively, in order, 5, 7, 5, 7, and 7 ""syllables"". A haiku only uses the first 3. It is also supposed to include a season reference.

  A haiku tries to capture an evanescent moment, its peculiar beauty, in a quintessencial way, in just a few words. It embraces the beauty of the very moment. To this, the spirit of hujemi connects a lot, and it thus a very relevant form of poetry to use with hujemi - especially as opposed to classic european versification, with hujemi can handle, but not as well (especially because it's not great at rhyming).

  I think the best way to implement chengyus into hujemi is to sixify them, thus proposing 6-syllables sayings. Among these 6 syllables, it's best to use 3 linear syllables (starting with a vowel) and 3 block ones (starting with a consonant). - Although it could be considered to go with just 6 phonemes, in 3 syllables - just like what the name of hujemi does.

  ...Unfortunately, no idea comes to my mind, so...let's move on to the next tactics.

  **5) Developped speech - fuxjogili**

  Developed speech is the opposite of small speech. It's the idea of adding many details and nuances to one's speech, words and phrases, typically using profusely the ending consonants. ""walking"" for instance would not be rendered as ""du"", which can mean many things, but as ""dut"" (walk-earth), or ""duv"" to mean ""go"", or even ""dutvu"" (walk-go), or ""dutlã"" (walk-line/long), etc.

  Note how developped speech and small speech use two different aspects and aims of the language (both to express a lot and to keep small and evasive). In other words, they are two aims that can be pursued at the same time, and not necessarily opposing tactics that you would have to choose among. In the same spirit is:

  **6) Block-gathering-speech - fujokohi**

  Fujokohi has similarities with developed speech, but it's still not the same concept. Fujokohi, in short, is agglutinative speech. It's using hujemi as an agglutinative language, making phrases into one word. This is totally permitted by the language, which accepts syllables being put together, without asking to separate strictly different words - actually the notion of ""word"" in hujemi is fairly loose.

  You can do such with adding new meanings/nuances to a given action or ""noun""; if you want to add the object of an action though, or the element of a ""noun"", etc., you want to add a vowel to connect the two ""words"". For instance, in my showcase translation (part 5), I wrote: EkotciEpeIUfupocfe to mean ""in a wooden hut covered in moss"". The connecting vowels are in capital letters (in linear script in hujemi writing system).

  This tactics is especially useful when you want to say sth about, for instance, an action. For instance, if you want to say ""crafting new languages is cool"", you can put together ""crafting new languages"". Which could make: ""BUCFUãHOFUXiPIS  uiSTIJI"".

  Reversely, one may try to speek hujemi in a very analytical and isolating way, notably through using a lot of vowel ""particles"". Even case markers before words may be admitted as separate words (provided they do come before the word they are for).

  **7) Free speech - fujoli**

  This doesn't really need its own name, but overall, the best is to use the different tools hujemi provides in one's personal way. To use sometimes the tactics mentioned here, without doing such systematically.

  **8) Future for hujemi**

  If you have been through the whole 6-parts presentation and have especially taken some time to see all the glyphs and base syllables (from parts 2 and 3), and looked in detail at my showcase translation in part 5, you should be ready to use the language by yourself, in your own way. Doing so in a personal, original way, even adapting it, defining words, maybe shifting (to some extent) the meaning of even base syllables, all this is not only admitted but awaited, and I would love to see other use my language and produce things with it, in their own personal way.

  I can't say it enough, hujemi is not complete until it is practiced by several speakers who adopt and adapt the language.

  Among things that I, personnally, should add, are works (poems and translations), additional documents (notably a ""reference dictionary"", which is especially needed for linear words), and maybe a few posts on how it works (as additions to the 6-parts presentation).

1874,0,"Greetings,

       I am new to this sub-reddit (and to Reddit in general) and I'd appreciate new conlanger friends, since I don't have any yet. 
       So I was thinking about making a conlang just for fun, without any fictional culture behind it or the intention of being international. Something like a stealthlang (a conlang made to communicate secretly between people) or a personal language. That being said, it would be different from projects like Viossa, since everything would be decided and designed by us, instead of being created spontaneously.
       For better communication, we can chat via Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. Just DM me or answer this post.
       Is there anyone interested in this idea? Please let me know.

1875,0,"So a little bit of back story.

I've been in a stagnant place with my main conlang for a while now. So, at least for now, I'm taking a break from developing it any further.

In the past couple of weeks though, I've been practising phonetic transcription. I created some new phonologies for future languages. Then, I remembered about u/yewwol's Tlattlaii; they said it had like 360 consonants. So I wondered ""what if I made a hypothetical phonology that was even BIGGER than  Tlattlaii's?"".

And thus, Infiniphone was born. It's basically a list of almost every phoneme listed in the IPA with many, many secondary articulations. I also included some new sounds (like the uvular lateral fricative  /ʟ̝̠̊/ and its corresponding affricate /q͡ʟ̠̝̥/ or coarticulated p͡c and b͡ɟ , or even ɸ͡ɬ and β͡ɮ).

I included almost every combination of basic secondary articulations and other airstream mechanisms; ejectives, implosives, coarticulations, aspirated, labialized, palatalized, pre-glottalized (only fricatives) and pre-nasalized. I also included combinations of them, so like labialized implosives, aspirated ejectives etc...

There are also pre-voiced stops and affricates (a feature from some Khoisan languages) like /b͡p/ ,/d͡t/, /g͡k/, /dt͡θ/, /dt͡s/ and /gk͡x/ all of which have their secondary articulation variants (so like /b͡pʷ/, /ɢ͡qʷ'/ and /ᵑgk͡x/).

For the vowels, I made a three-way distinction between long, short, nasal with a three-tone system (high, level, low) and combinations thereof (so like long nasal, high short etc...).

All of this brings the total number of phonemes to 876, with 133 vowels and 743 consonants. Of course, this isn't meant to be a naturalistic phonology, that would be waaaay too many sounds. Still, it was fun to see how many unique sounds one could create.

Here's the link if you want to check out Infiniphone for yourself: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Wulmdcj4\_UC-eC1iwoFO2vADnqNRRDm/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=107392315267965714618&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Wulmdcj4_UC-eC1iwoFO2vADnqNRRDm/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=107392315267965714618&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)

As far as I'm aware, this is the biggest phonology for a conlang ever. If you know a bigger set of sounds (or have created one yourself ;), please let me know in the comments.

Thanks for reading.

Also, I know the orthography is a mess, but that's the best I could come up with. Romanizing                  /ᵐb̪p̪͡fʷ'/ without using my entire keyboard would be basically impossible XD.","Infiniphone, the biggest phonology EVER","So a little bit of back story.

1876,0,"In your conlang, which is the biggest number you get in your conlang?

In my conlangs, I never get too far with numbers. I start from the assumption that, as I only create ""aboriginal"" or ""indigenous"" languages, they never will use big numbers as million or billion. Because these numbers technically only exist in more complex maths. So in mangalese (that is spoken by a people more ""evolved"" in terms of technology, society, etc. more and less as evolved as the Mayans or Mexicas in pre-Columbian America), the highest number is *tutumana*, thousand. Maybe they will use higher numbers because they have more knowledge about maths.

The Phunatunas, who are more like nautic gipsies, the highest number they know, actually is not a number: *rani*, or *ranik* in feminine, which means many.

1878,0,"I feel like a big way to make conlangs feel fleshed out is to talk about them in their own terms.  Here’s a list of basic grammatical terms and brief etymological notes.  All values are IPA with word derivation information below.  Would be keen to see some examples of how others have constructed words for grammatical terms in their languages.

**Uorivakeor**
Linguistics - *uorivas* ‘study’ + *keor* ‘language’

**Kokundrette**
Linguist - *ku/ko-* ‘agent’ + *kundre* ‘linguistic’

**Uorivaseuttao**
Phonology - *uorivas* ‘study’ + *seuttao* ‘sound’

**Fuaraseuttao**
Phonotactics - *fuaras* ‘mortar’ + *seuttao* ‘sound’

**Aralloser**
Word derivation - *arallo* present participle of *arað* ‘to create’ + *ser* ‘word’

**Uorivasere**
Grammar - *uorivas* ‘study’ + *sere* ‘words’

**Doroser**
Noun - *doro* ‘name’ + *ser* ‘word’

**Tavaraser**
Adjective - from *tavareað* ‘to stretch’ + *ser* ‘word’

**Lieser**
Postposition - *lie* ‘behind’ + *ser* ‘word’

**Īroneaser**
Verb - from *īroneað* ‘to move’ + *ser* ‘word’

**Maðanser**
Adverb - *maðan* ‘with’ + *ser* ‘word’

**Maðauvake**
Numeral - partitive noun from *maðomaute* ‘to divide’

**Word formation notes**
Agēre is head-marking so the head (or more important noun) often comes first, e.g. *uoriva-sere* ‘study(of)-words’, though this is not always the case, e.g. *īronea-ser* ‘move-word’.  Various parts of speech can appear in compounds, such as nouns *doro* ‘name’, verbs *taraveað* ‘to stretch’, and adverbs *maðan* ‘with’.  The agentive prefix *ku/ko-* is derived from the proto-root √gung meaning ‘friend’.  *ku-* is the drfault form whereas *ko-* is used before
syllables containing /u/, e.g. *kokundrette*.

I  want to ""translate"" something into Written Canthan, a fictional  language from Guild Wars 2 (a pretty famous MMORPG). Problem is, the  material is very limited (there's no complete resources to learn/use  it); however, it is based on Hangul (as explained in [this article](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/designing-the-canthan-written-language/), wich also contains the closest thing to a guide i could find). I also found some more resources [here](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Language#Old_Canthan) (wich contains numbers and other various words) and [here](https://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k279/Shi-Violet/CanthanAlphabet.jpg) (a list of other words in Canthan, unfortunately i can't find it in better resolution). Also [here](https://twitter.com/guildwars2/status/1425847767688114180) are some twitter posts wich contain other words published last year.

So, to do an artwork i wanted to ""translate"" the word **tiger** and a phrase (wich i still have to compose) into Canthan. I know that  the material is almost non-existent, and also the ""language"" is  something only built up to resemble an asian written language, so  obviously i'm not asking for a 100% accurate translation, just something  credible.

Thanks to anyone who's willing to embark on this quest!","""Translation"" needed for an artwork"," Hey there!

This week's paper talks about converbs in Afroasiatic and Nilo-Saharan languages. Haspelmath &amp; König's book ""Converbs in Cross-Linguistic Perspective"" defines a converb as ""a nonfinite verb form whose main function is to mark adverbial subordination"". A basic English example for this is ""He's walking down the street *singing songs*"", where the expressed sense of subordination is simultaneous (""while""). Now onto the prompts:

* Does your language feature converbs?
    * Which categories are expressed by converbs? (E.g. temporal sequence, conditional semantics etc.)
    * How does switch-reference interact with converbs in your language?
    * How can the syntax of converb constructions be described?
* If your language does not have converbs, how is adverbial subordination expressed? (E.g. by conjunctions)

1) Post a word in your language, with IPA and a definition.

Note: try to show your word inflected, as it would appear in a typical sentence. This can be the source of many interesting borrowings in natlangs (like how so many Arabic words were borrowed with the definite article fossilized onto it! algebra, alcohol, etc.)

3) Sometimes, you may see an interesting phrase or construction in a language.

It involved the creation of several new words (stare, imagine, balance, manage, concrete, drab, easy, flickering, somewhere-ADV) and was overall a very fun exercise. Hope you enjoy!

Focus(INF) impossible be(3SN PAST). About the concrete dull, by a light white and flickering somewhere them above (P PART)-illuminate(3SN PAST), contemplate(INF) more easy be(3SN PAST).

^(† This word means a magical tool rather than an agent of change or accelerant of a chemical reaction. The title in English takes advantage of  all definitions of the word, but the more specific meaning seemed appropriate for the translation.)

^(‡ Terréän doesn't associate the buzzing of bees with confusion/disorientation, so I used ""mumble"" to create a sense of mental noise and incoherence, which was my original meaning.)

1918,0,"Morphosyntactic alignment is one of, if not my *absolute*, favorite thing to fuck around with when making new languages. As it pervades every single sentence in the language, an interestingly unique alignment can impart a base level of interesting challenge to every sentence you translate.

The only thing more boring than nom/acc is direct. Erg/abs is a bit better; tripartite and transitive are better still. Split-S, fluid-S and inverse-hierarchical are where it really gets spicy - and I still don't understand Austronesian.

But can we go *further?* Can we set languages up with an even more extreme departure from the same old nom/acc?

Chdequli is erg/abs with a twist - it's secundative, in that there is only one object case to cover both DO and IO, but which role it plays is determined by the *subject* marking - if the subject is ergative, then the object is direct; if the subject is pegative, then the object is indirect. Since the subject can't be doubly marked, clauses can't have both a DO and IO, and ditransitives have to be split up with a same-subject switch-reference(?) (e.g. ""the man gave the woman a rose"" → ""the man(PEG) gave the woman(OBJ), the same(ERG) gave a rose(OBJ)"").

Middle Äpʰšʷür uses a bastard child of erg/abs and split-S where there are essentially two erg/abs systems in use at the same time - ergative-absolutive (oblique IO) and pegative-oblique (absolutive IO) - and which one you use depends on the class of the verb.

Proto-West-Icharon did a sort of 2/3 split-S, 1/3 fluid-S system with 3 core argument cases: active, middle and passive (yes, I stole the names from verb voices, shut up). For intransitive verbs, the case of their sole argument is up to verb class; transitive verbs by default always have an active subject and a passive DO, but can alternatively solely take a middle argument, in which case they are interpreted as reflexive (or autobenefactive?).

The Dingir languages have a *quadripartite* alignment - like tripartite, except the absolutive is split into two separate cases, one for when the sole argument is agentive/high-volition, and one for when the sole argument is patientive/low-volition.

Now, I want to hear your interesting new alignments, or at least interesting new spins on already extant alignments.

1926,0,"Hello! I'm so new to conlanging, sorry if this is probably a silly question but I can't seem to find any info on this - there are a lot of explanations of what for example proto-indo-european case endings looked like, but not where they actually come from.  


I watched a bunch of biblaridion videos, which is really where all my knowledge of this stuff comes from and he gave some examples, but everything I do seems to take me to possessee-marking rather than possessor-marking.  


So here's what I did. Originally I just thought ""Ok I'll just add some postposition meaning ""of"" coming from the verb ""to have"" ... and that was ok for a while but then I thought - wait a second, that doesn't exactly make sense immediately... Why would people start saying things like ""He ate he had food"" to mean ""He ate his food""? (He = ""he"", ate = ""fima se"", food = ""naro"", he has = ""au"").

""He naro au fima se"" =&gt; which in the derived language was meant to turn into something like ""Naroa eau fimas"" - that definitely doesn't work for the word order, which is subject-object-verb.  


So I thought ok what do I have in my protolang that I could use to construct possession... I came up with this:  
""He has food and he eats it"" = ""Fe naro au i he fima""... which again, you'd see the ""au"" verb attaching to the possessee, rather than the possessor.   


How does this happen in natural languages? How does a suffix/postposition denoting possession emerge and attach to a subject, rather than an object? That doesn't seem like it can happen in what I have. What am I missing here?

I'm trying to figure out how to make a machine translator for my conlang. My goal is for it to be two-directional between English and my conlang. I've seen the topic of conlang machine translation come up many times on this subreddit before, but I'm curious if anyone has worked on a translator using a **transformer** model in particular. Transformers are a relatively new technology in the Natural Language Processing field, only being introduced as recently as 2017.  

By ""meaningful"" sentences, I mean randomly generated using vocabulary relevant to specific domains such as descriptions of animals, vehicles, video gaming, cooking, etc.  

I could generate purely random sentences like, ""The oranges baked the tractor."" It is grammatically correct, but nonsensical in meaning. I'm not sure if sentences such as these would be helpful or harmful for training a translation system.  

I have been investigating open-source transformer models such as OpenNMT-py and GPT-J-6B. My goal is to train one of these models with a parallel corpus of at least 1,000,000 sentence pairs between English and my conlang.  

If I manually type 100 sentences a day, it would take me over 27 years to reach the 1 million mark. Thus, I was hoping to type out about 5000 and use these as a representative sample to generate the millions I need to train the translation model.  

\--------------------------------  

To avoid the relex problem in conlang machine translation, my conlang is markedly different from English in the following ways:  

\- Polysemy distribution - Frequent words having multiple senses in my conlang do not have an identical distribution of senses to those in English.  

\- Collocations - Juxtaposed words / set phrases in my conlang are not identical to those in English. E.g. ""mighty computer"" and ""dark tea"" in my conlang vs. ""powerful computer"" and ""strong tea"" in English. While the senses are similar, the juxtaposed words are not identical.  

\- Syntax - My conlang uses focus-fronting, wh-in-situ, and has word order changes based on noun salience not found in English.  

\- Morphology - My conlang has two applicatives, a clitic system that can mark heads or dependents for different purposes, various converbs, and other key differences from English. My conlang also has some associated motion in its deixis, including reciprocal motion as a possibility.  

\- Homophone density - My conlang has a moderately high number of homophones compared to English. Tone distinctions occur on the stressed syllable. Various affixes, contractions, and sandhi effects can shift the position of the stress, changing the tone as well. The tone change is somewhat conditioned by phonotactics, but it is largely unpredictable.  

All of these points are to illustrate that my conlang is not a relex of English, and thus machine translation would not increase the risk of relexification. I still would like to generate at least 1,000,000 domain-specific sentences in my conlang. The goal is not only to train the system on sentence structure but also a general sense of pragmatics in specific domains.  

I think procedurally generating 1,000,000 sentences would be optimal for my goals, as long as I have some metric to ensure the grammaticality of the sentences, as well as minimizing ""The oranges baked the tractor""-type, asemic-yet-still-grammatical sentences.  

\--------------------------------  

I am still learning Python and I have high ambition and low skill. How can I begin to pursue this project of generating plausible sentences in the millions? I've been trying to significantly expand my conlang's vocabulary and the number of translated sentences I have, as well as researching ways to tokenize the words, but I'm still a novice in this whole area of machine learning.  

Say my conlang's full grammar has about 800 grammar points, (just an arbitrarily large number, including relativization, discourse, derivational affixes, special uses of case forms, etc.). I would try to weave each of those points at least once into my stock of 5000 example sentences, with the hope that the transformer model would then be able to intuit the rules from the examples, instead of using a strictly rules-based system such as Apertium.

1933,0,"  I found this text in the r/conlangs and I decided it was a good text to translate, for a showcase purpose. You can read this by itself and with little notion of hujemi, although it's mostly aimed for people who interest themselves in this language and will really see the text in hujemi, not just the gloss and translation.

  My aim here is to show the whole process of writing, here translating, in hujime.

The text is the following one:

 *An old man lived alone with his dog on a small, rocky island. They lived in a wooden hut covered in moss. The sky was always gray and it rained often. The old man had gray hair and a thick, wiry beard. The dog was big with a long, brown coat. Each morning, the old man drank a bitter tea and shared cold leftovers with his dog. In the afternoon, he walked to the shore to catch some fish. The dog chased away seagulls that wanted to steal the tasty fish. The old man then chopped firewood, and the dog sat by his side, guarding the fish. In the evening, the man salted and cooked the fish, and ate them with the dog. They slept by the warm fire to keep away the bitter cold. His life was simple, but so long as he had his dog, the old man was happy.* 

Here, a link to see the full translation:

&amp;#x200B;

Preliminary note on the Romanization system.

I recently made two adaptations to my Romanization system. The first one is x codes for the th /θ and the c for the sh /ʃ. The second is that I now indicate linear writing by writing it in capital letters.

So, taking the first sentence:

 *An old man lived alone with his dog on a small, rocky island.*

So, what I am gonna do with this very first sentence, is to do it all, step by step, so you see the full process. Ofc I am gonna give up to details that I actually don't really compute myself because they are things I already ""solved"" and process automatically. So anyway,

the first thing to do is to look for a context in this sentence. Indeed, the best, proper way to write a hujemi sentence is to do context + action, even though it's not mandatory. Here, the context is a small, rocky island.

What is a small etc.? It's an island. What's an island? it's a land surrounded by water. So there would be a way to write that all (toIUfukOle\*) typically, but since it's pretty clear what tol would be (land-water), it's amply sufficient.

\* : to = land (earth + IND), I = adj, U = V, fu = *cover*, actualize..., k = hard, *outside*, ... O = IND, le = water (or la = sea).

There is no particular reason to separate the island and its being small and rocky, especially since these are small to write anyway. small = ci, rock(y) = ke(i). Thus, the whole is:

EtolIkeIci. ""on/about a small, rocky island""

Note how I put rocky first, then ""small"", in my translation. It actually follows the same order than English, it's just that in English the qualifier comes before what it qualifies.

Now what about that island? Well, a man and a dog live here. Since there are two subjects, it can be best to start with the verb. ""Uzu"" can do for ""live(d)"" (we don't need to specify the past). That being said, the meaning is more that they were spending their life, their time, here, so we can add ""lu"" (to stream; to pass time etc.), making ""Uzulu"".

What kind of thing is an old man? Well, it's a man, ""da"". Since it's a man, that is, a male, we can specify it with ""vi"". It's not absolutely necessary, but we want to follow the text; and by doing so here, we won't need to specify the gender anymore in the following sentences.

We could add ""his dog"" immediately in the sentence, but we can connect them with ""and"". A way to do it would be to use ""ihi"", ""and, with"". But we will use it later, and here we can emphasize rather on the fact that they are two (different beings) in this island, so we'll go for ""iki"". Fun fact, I had first translated ""ihi"", so I had to fix that on Paint; I am very perfectionist. - Ofc, ""ihi"" would 've been very accurate as well.

There are ways to render ""dog"" in hujime, but for this word we have the borrowing ""gao"" (from Chinese gou (dog), also similar to Spanish ""guau"" (woof), but also to ""mao"" (cat), which is the best word for cat, I think.

To which we add ""iad"", ""their"" (his). So there we have it:

https://preview.redd.it/4pt2h6aigkf81.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b03628805a3f00a78165ed0b281584a714a8a33

**ET  otolIkeIci  Uzulu  Odaviifti  IKI  OGAO  IAD.**

(ah, that's write, I wrote ET Otol ... not Etol... ""in an island..."", in = et.)

    e-t        o-to-l-i-ke-i-ci                      u-zu-lu  
    ctx-space  IND-place-water-adj-stone-adj-little  V-live-stream
    o-da-vi-i-fti            iki   o-gao    i-a-d.
    IND-man*-masc-adj-""fti""  and  IND-dog  adj-DEF-man*
    *: ""man"" = human

*""In the island-rocky-small lived a man-old and a dog-his.""*

&amp;#x200B;

The next sentence:

*They lived in a wooden hut covered in moss.*

(From now on I will comment my translating process without describing every step)

Here you don't need to repeat the subject, which will be ommitted. The sentence may start with the verb, ""live"" again. Since here it's got to do with where they live, we can connect it to ""t"" and ""m"", instead of ""lu"".

""moss"" can be rendered with po (plant) cfe (dust, particles), although other options would have been possible.

The following sentence is:

*The sky was always gray and it rained often.*

Since it's about the weather, one could use ""va"" for the sky, but I think we are going to use ""fa"", ""heaven, up, sky"", to give the notion that it's the one sky, what's beyond them, and that it rains from atop. ""rain"" can thus be rendered with ""just"" ""tiule"", falling water.

Here is the translation of the two sentences:

&amp;#x200B;

""kot"" was used to say ""hut"". ""ko"" is a building, and I added ""t"" to mean it's sth ""earthy"", I think you get me. Other options were possible.

For ""always"", I used ""ehaski"", which gives the notion of sth universal, with a reference to the sky (""ska"" is the sky).

I rendered the colour ""grey"" with ""jesklof"" instead of using ""k"" or things like that, to mean grey in a sky way, so to speak. Also, ""kl"" can mean ""cloud"".

Note how, in the last sentence, the sky is somewhat suggested to be the subject of the raining, as well as how I constructed the sentence with the E : A\_  E\_  I\_\_  E\_\_  U\_\_.

I will try to limit my comments for the following, to not make this analysis over long and excessive.

&amp;#x200B;

*The old man had gray hair and a thick, wiry beard. The dog was big with a long, brown coat.*

""gray"" will be rendered with ""cf"" (dust), and ""thick, wiry"" with ""gizai"" (big, natural/wild).

Instead of saying sth like the man has, I will say about the man... And similarly for the dog.

*Each morning, the old man drank a bitter tea and shared cold leftovers with his dog.*

For ""each"", ""all"", you can use ""f"", which means that as an ending (f : the sky, the whole, what covers, the end...). ""leftovers"" was not easy, but I find an interesting way to render cold leftovers:

*Life-his  be  simple  but  as-long-as-(connect)with-dog  man  happy.""*",A detailed showcase translation in Hujemi (a presentation - 5),"  I found this text in the r/conlangs and I decided it was a good text to translate, for a showcase purpose. You can read this by itself and with little notion of hujemi, although it's mostly aimed for people who interest themselves in this language and will really see the text in hujemi, not just the gloss and translation.

  My aim here is to show the whole process of writing, here translating, in hujime.

The text is the following one:

 *An old man lived alone with his dog on a small, rocky island. They lived in a wooden hut covered in moss. The sky was always gray and it rained often. The old man had gray hair and a thick, wiry beard. The dog was big with a long, brown coat. Each morning, the old man drank a bitter tea and shared cold leftovers with his dog. In the afternoon, he walked to the shore to catch some fish. The dog chased away seagulls that wanted to steal the tasty fish. The old man then chopped firewood, and the dog sat by his side, guarding the fish. In the evening, the man salted and cooked the fish, and ate them with the dog. They slept by the warm fire to keep away the bitter cold. His life was simple, but so long as he had his dog, the old man was happy.* 

Here, a link to see the full translation:

&amp;#x200B;

Preliminary note on the Romanization system.

I recently made two adaptations to my Romanization system. The first one is x codes for the th /θ and the c for the sh /ʃ. The second is that I now indicate linear writing by writing it in capital letters.

So, taking the first sentence:

 *An old man lived alone with his dog on a small, rocky island.*

So, what I am gonna do with this very first sentence, is to do it all, step by step, so you see the full process. Ofc I am gonna give up to details that I actually don't really compute myself because they are things I already ""solved"" and process automatically. So anyway,

the first thing to do is to look for a context in this sentence. Indeed, the best, proper way to write a hujemi sentence is to do context + action, even though it's not mandatory. Here, the context is a small, rocky island.

What is a small etc.? It's an island. What's an island? it's a land surrounded by water. So there would be a way to write that all (toIUfukOle\*) typically, but since it's pretty clear what tol would be (land-water), it's amply sufficient.

\* : to = land (earth + IND), I = adj, U = V, fu = *cover*, actualize..., k = hard, *outside*, ... O = IND, le = water (or la = sea).

There is no particular reason to separate the island and its being small and rocky, especially since these are small to write anyway. small = ci, rock(y) = ke(i). Thus, the whole is:

EtolIkeIci. ""on/about a small, rocky island""

Note how I put rocky first, then ""small"", in my translation. It actually follows the same order than English, it's just that in English the qualifier comes before what it qualifies.

Now what about that island? Well, a man and a dog live here. Since there are two subjects, it can be best to start with the verb. ""Uzu"" can do for ""live(d)"" (we don't need to specify the past). That being said, the meaning is more that they were spending their life, their time, here, so we can add ""lu"" (to stream; to pass time etc.), making ""Uzulu"".

What kind of thing is an old man? Well, it's a man, ""da"". Since it's a man, that is, a male, we can specify it with ""vi"". It's not absolutely necessary, but we want to follow the text; and by doing so here, we won't need to specify the gender anymore in the following sentences.

We could add ""his dog"" immediately in the sentence, but we can connect them with ""and"". A way to do it would be to use ""ihi"", ""and, with"". But we will use it later, and here we can emphasize rather on the fact that they are two (different beings) in this island, so we'll go for ""iki"". Fun fact, I had first translated ""ihi"", so I had to fix that on Paint; I am very perfectionist. - Ofc, ""ihi"" would 've been very accurate as well.

There are ways to render ""dog"" in hujime, but for this word we have the borrowing ""gao"" (from Chinese gou (dog), also similar to Spanish ""guau"" (woof), but also to ""mao"" (cat), which is the best word for cat, I think.

To which we add ""iad"", ""their"" (his). So there we have it:

https://preview.redd.it/4pt2h6aigkf81.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b03628805a3f00a78165ed0b281584a714a8a33

**ET  otolIkeIci  Uzulu  Odaviifti  IKI  OGAO  IAD.**

(ah, that's write, I wrote ET Otol ... not Etol... ""in an island..."", in = et.)

    IND-man*-masc-adj-""fti""  and  IND-dog  adj-DEF-man*
    *: ""man"" = human

*""In the island-rocky-small lived a man-old and a dog-his.""*

&amp;#x200B;

The next sentence:

*They lived in a wooden hut covered in moss.*

(From now on I will comment my translating process without describing every step)

Here you don't need to repeat the subject, which will be ommitted. The sentence may start with the verb, ""live"" again. Since here it's got to do with where they live, we can connect it to ""t"" and ""m"", instead of ""lu"".

""moss"" can be rendered with po (plant) cfe (dust, particles), although other options would have been possible.

The following sentence is:

*The sky was always gray and it rained often.*

Since it's about the weather, one could use ""va"" for the sky, but I think we are going to use ""fa"", ""heaven, up, sky"", to give the notion that it's the one sky, what's beyond them, and that it rains from atop. ""rain"" can thus be rendered with ""just"" ""tiule"", falling water.

Here is the translation of the two sentences:

  It's been a while since last episode, for several reasons, including that I wanted to create my own font for my language.

Summary:

1) Recap

2) Linear writing

3) Grammar (other)

# 1) Recapitulation, in short

  As a recap, Hujemi is an oligosynthetic language where every phoneme is associated with a glyph and a meaning, with vowels having a rather grammatical rule. Words are made of syllables which are made of an initial consonant giving the core meaning/element, and a vowel, with a vowel or/and a consonant that may be added. The word is generally introduced by a vowel indicating its role in the sentence - it's basically a case marker.

The syllables are written with the initial consonant on a part of an imaginary square, and the next phonemes on the other half. Here is an example:

  

https://preview.redd.it/8y0ypc5f5ff81.png?width=1123&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15cb59590077e919380633151ca98699dfc1c7cf

In order: ta (Earth), fa (sky), zo (animal), po (plant), su (shine), and ji (beautiful, moody).

As you can see, the initial can be placed at the top, bottom, or left (depending on the glyph).

# 2) Linear writing

Now, this works for the main words, so to speak, the nouns, the verbs, etc., but several things are written in what I call ""linear writing"", which, as the name says, is written in a linear (classic) way, and which role is similar to the kanas in Japanese.

Linear writing is used for the four following purposes (by order of importance):

1) ""case marker"". As I said, words normally start by a vowel indicating its role in the sentence, a kind of case marker. It's written in linear.

2) ""particles"" (similar to prepositions, and also articles). These start with a vowel, and help connect phrases. ""Case markers"" can be considered as a subgroup.

3) Names. Names will typically use linear writing, except when you want to insist on their meaning.

4) Loanwords. These include proper names like those for languages or countries (you could consider ""3"" is a subcategory of this one), as well as words for enriching the vocabulary, which are derived from words from actual language, or sometimes from proper nouns.

A yet-to-enriched/completed list can be found here:

*(in ""proper noun"", green for a meaningful relevant hujemi, yellow when it's kinda linked, orange when sorta meaningful but not relevant, red for gibberish)*

Here is an example of a sentence including linear writing:

This is the sentence for today's ""used 5 min of your day"", with Musa. It reads (in Romanization):

*I used capital letters for the ""base writing system"", so to speak (tbh the font functions with the other way around). x for θ and c for ʃ.*

**ue**XUFRU  PUSÃM**u**FATIULE  **u**BUCHO  **musa**  **ã**PET.

**while**\-thinking-scared  grow-now-**verb**\-sky-fall-water  **verb**\-act-group  **musa**  **acc**\-grass.

""Fearing it can/start-raining did Musa collect grass.""

""musa"" is an example of ""3"", and the rest can be classed as ""1"" or ""2"".

# 3) Grammar - other

Grammar is, by design, very loose in Hujemi. There is no base conjugation (you can specify time/tense with things like sãk, past, ue = imperfect), no base gender or number (there are solutions to specify it), etc. When I say no ""base"" etc., I mean that you can use the glyph-roots to reconstruct these meanings, but they don't exactly exist as words on their own with only a grammatical meaning. The exception being perhaps vowels - but vowels also have a semantic role.

Even pronouns are derived from glyph-roots. You use ""a"" followed by the consonant that matches what you want to denote for. you can also add a vowel after the consonant, to add further precision. This means that there is no core distinction between the definite and a pronoun ""an(i)"", ""she"", and ""ani"", the girl, are basically the same.

Actually, the fact that there are kind of case markers also reinforces the grammatical, syntactic looseness of the language. Indeed it helps you choosing your own word order.

What I really want to empasize here is that this language is not made to be something to (passively) learn, what I did was creating a developed concept which can be used by speakers, its arbitrariness and elements to learn being reduced to a minimum. A concept which would still be functional and rich in potential. It's an experience, of the synesthetic kind.

So the way I've imagined it, was that putting the verb before the subject, or with no subject, was a way to indicate sth like the subjunctive or imperative. Also, that the context would better start the sentence. And the emphasis can be put on the first or/and last word of the sentence. But these are just general indications.

To understand how it works, you can check my translations. I will provide a (very) detailed one on the next part of this presentation.","Grammar and linear writing in Hujemi (a presentation, 4)","  Hi all.

Prenoun (PL: ""przedrzeczownik"") is a thing that marks a noun. The Prenoun is named ""nyc"" and as the name says it's placed before every noun, but not like in english. In english, it would be ""the white cat"", in imperial ""white the cat"". That's why it's ""możny nyc rumar"" (""imperial the language"") and not ""nyc możny rumar"" (""the imperial language"").

""To be"" verb here is divided only by time and not by persons, so ""I is, You is, They is"" etc.

| Time | To be |
|:----|----:|
| Past | minar |
| Present | im |
| Future | rur |

**Plural Number**

Creating plural number is very simple, just add ""ż"" at end of the word, when using The Imperial Alphabet, mark symbol ""/\"" above first letter of this word.

**Using words**

No, I don't mean a dictionary. The Imperial Language has a function to ""use"" a word.

To ""use"" a word, you have to add ""ś"" at the end of it, or write ""\/"" above the first letter of the word, for example ""rurwm"" (sword) will become ""rurwmś"" (cut) after ""using"" it.

**Dot**

The dot symbol in imperial alphabet is not used. In it's place there's ""|"" symbol that marks the end of the sentence.

**Saying no**

Just add ""rum"" (no) between the person and the ""to be"" verb, like this: ""brur rur nyr nyc marm"" (you will have a house) ---&gt; ""brur rum rur nyr nyc marm"" (you won't have a house).

**Asking Questions**

Another very simple thing, just add wanted question marker at the very beginning of the word. Here are some QMs:

| English | Imperial |
|:-----|-----:|
| If | najir |
| How | nab |

Some examples:

""brur minar nyr nyc marm"" (you had a house) ---&gt; ""najir brur minar nyr nyc marm"" (did you have a house?""

""nab brur minar  jaemor nyc możrunymarm"" (how was school?)

Eh, not too many of them.

**Imperative**

There's at not no imperative at all

**Ownerships**

Very simple, person and thing: ""nyc możrunymarm"" (school) ---&gt; ""raemo nyc możrunymarm"" (my school)

**Finish**",My first conlang I ever made - Imperial Language,"**Introduction**

Imperial Language (PL: ""Język Cesarski"", MNR: ""możny nyc rumar"", GŁW: ""Fuzyk cysruy"") was the first conlang I ever made, some months ago for The United Kingdom fictional country (pronounced as ""ZK"" and not ""UK""!!!!).

**Writing system**

I made a 13-letter alphabet for it, that combines all possible sounds to weird letters. You can check it here https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2038501/imperial-alphabet-1 or at least bad copy of it. Letters are:

| **Letter** | **IPA** |
|:--------|--------:|

| m | /'m/ |
| aemo | /ˈaɛmɔ/ |

| b | /'b/ |
| c | /'t͡s/ |
| moż | /mˈɔʒ/ |
| ny | /nˈɨ/ |
| na | /nˈa/ |

**Grammar**

Sentence structure is SVO.

**Persons**

| ENGLISH | IMPERIAL |
|:----|-----:|
| I | Raemo /raˈɛmɔ/ |
| Singular You | Brur /brˈur/ |
| He/She/It | - (none, at least I haven't found anything about that) |
| We | Raemoż /raˈɛmɔʒ/ |
| Plural You | Brurż /brˈurʒ/ |
| They | Brurż /brˈurʒ/ |

**Prenoun**

Prenoun (PL: ""przedrzeczownik"") is a thing that marks a noun. The Prenoun is named ""nyc"" and as the name says it's placed before every noun, but not like in english. In english, it would be ""the white cat"", in imperial ""white the cat"". That's why it's ""możny nyc rumar"" (""imperial the language"") and not ""nyc możny rumar"" (""the imperial language"").

**To be**

""To be"" verb here is divided only by time and not by persons, so ""I is, You is, They is"" etc.

1960,0,"*Hanyu'e hahisas uliha!* This is an introduction to my conlang, Kalti.

Some background: Kalti is one of many languages spoken in my unnamed (for now) fantasy world, along with English, Aquatican, Sky Tongue, Elvish, Faerie, and Aquarian. Kalti was once spoken by each of the six shapeshifter species, but due to an extinction event, there are only two shapeshifter species, phoenixes and beast folk, of whom only phoenixes speak Kalti on an everyday basis.

Kalti is what I'm calling a ""template language."" Being a language spoken by 6 very different species with very different cultures, it made little sense for all species to speak the same language in the same way. The gods (a.k.a. me :P) recognized this and created Kalti as a template language, consisting of the core elements necessary for communication, as well as some vocabulary and grammar rules. It is based heavily on Korean and Japanese, though the phonology is quite different. It originally lacked any mechanism to indicate tense, aspect, or mood (other than by elaborating with additional words) and did not have any terms with which to refer to the specifics of each culture (e.g. clothing). From there, the speakers developed various ways of expressing the missing features by building off the existing system and/or borrowing from other languages.

This post will focus on Template Kalti, the original form of Kalti given to the shapeshifters by the gods.

I come with greetings.

# Phonology

**Consonants**

||Bilabial-Labiodental|Alveolar|Palatal|Velar|Uvular|Glottal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nasal|m|n||ŋ|||
|Plosive|p b|t d||k g|q|ʔ|
|Sibilant|s z||||||
|Fricative|f v|||x-χ||h|
|Approximant|||j||||
|Trill|||||ʀ||
|Lateral||l|||||

The voiced counterpart to \[q\], \[ɢ\], is pronounced in Kalti, but it is not considered a separate phoneme from \[q\].

**Vowels**

a \[a\]

i \[i\]

u \[o\] \[ʊ\] \[u\]

Here are my rules for determining how U is pronounced, though there may be variation among the different Kalti dialects. Stop as soon as one of the conditions is met.

* if it is stressed, it is pronounced as \[o\]
   * single-syllable words are treated as stressed
* if the preceding vowel is A or I, it is pronounced as \[ʊ\]
* if the preceding vowel is U, it is pronounced as \[u\]
* \[at this point the only remaining cases are those where the U is the first vowel of the word\]
* if the following vowel is \[o\], it is pronounced as \[o\]
* if the following vowel is \[ʊ\] or I, it is pronounced as \[ʊ\]
* if the following vowel is A or \[u\], it is pronounced as \[u\]

These rules were decided somewhat arbitrary based on how I ended up pronouncing U in various placements within a word. Granted, I am not a native Kalti speaker (though I find it to be one of the easiest for me personally to pronounce).

**Diphthongs**

Diphthongs can be formed via any combination of the above 3 vowels, but only if the correct syllable is unstressed.

A + unstressed I -&gt; \[ai\]

A + unstressed U -&gt; \[aʊ\]

unstressed I + A -&gt; \[ja\]

unstressed I + U -&gt; \[ju\]

unstressed U + A -&gt; \[wa\]

unstressed U + I -&gt; \[wi\]

Additionally, there is a 'Y' diacritic that turns \[a\] and \[u\] into \[ja\] and \[ju\], respective.

**Palatalization**

Consonants palatalize immediately preceding the \[j\] sound.

t → tʃ, d → dʒ

q → k, ɢ → g

s/x → ʃ, z/ɣ → ʒ

**Syllable Structure**

The basic syllable structure is CV. The vowel is optional for nasals, \[f\], \[s\], \[x\], and \[l\].

# Romanization

For the most part, the romanization will match the IPA spelling. Exceptions are listed below.

ng \[ŋ\]

' \[ʔ\]

kh \[x-χ\]

ʀ \[gg\]

u \[o\] \[ʊ\] \[u\]\*

ch \[tʃ\]

j \[dʒ\]

sh \[ʃ\]

zh \[ʒ\]

\*sometimes, I use O for \[o\] instead of U

Additionally, h is silent in the middle of words, while the glottal stop (') is silent at the start of words unless the preceding word ends with a vowel. In IPA, these letters are not spelled out, but in the romanization, they are.

# Grammar

**Word Order**

Kalti is primarily an SOV (verb-final) language. However, when using the first person singular pronoun as the subject of the main clause of the sentence, it is more polite to place it at the end of the sentence. Contrast the following sentences.

Ja dasingha zhumazi'u lahyakhas.

She likes pork.

    Ja   dasing-ha zhumazi-’u lahyakha-s.
    That woman-TOP pork-DO    like-MAIN_VERB.

Zhumazi’u qi lahyakhas uliha.

I don’t like pork.

    Zhumazi-’u qi  lahyakha-s.    uli-ha.
    pork-DO    not like-MAIN_VERB I-TOP.

Uliha zhumazi’u qi lahyakhadima, ja dasingha lahyakhas.

I don’t like pork, but she does.

    Uli-ha zhumazi-’u qi  lahyakha-dima, ja   dasing-ha lahyakha-s.
    I-TOP  pork-DO    not like-but,      that woman-TOP like-MAIN_VERB.

The first sentence represents the typical SOV structure. The subject (the woman) comes first, then the object (pork), then the verb (like).

In the second sentence, the sentence becomes OVS because the subject is ""I.""

In the third sentence, the subject of the first clause is ""I,"" but this is not the main clause. In order to use the ""but"" particle (more on that later), it must come at the end of the verb and immediately before the following clause. This is not possible if the subject is after the verb. Therefore, *uliha* is moved back to the front of the sentence.

Note that if the order of the clauses were flipped, *uliha* would go back to the end of the sentence.

Ja dasingha zhumazi’u lahyakhadima, qi lahyakhas uliha.

She likes pork, but I don't.

    Ja   dasing-ha zhumazi-’u lahyakha-dima, qi  lahyakha-s     uli-ha.
    that woman-TOP pork-DO    like-but,      not like-MAIN_VERB I-TOP.

**Grammatical Number**

For the most part, number is not grammaticalized. ""the dog ate"" and ""the dogs ate"" translate to the exact same sentence, with context providing information about number, if relevant. However, the suffix *-daŋ* can be used to indicate plurality if it is important to the message you want to convey.

The only other time grammatical number pops up in Kalti is in pronouns.

This here's a quote from the CIA project ""Artichoke,"" one of a series of illegal inhumane experiments performed by the CIA. Many of these projects were based on learning new interrogation methods, and  this one studied such things as hypnosis, forced morphine addiction, potential of viruses to be used in interrogation, LSD, and other experimental drugs. These projects were done overseas as well, in Europe, Japan, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia. One of the primary goals of Project Artichoke was to determine whether or not they could get an individual to commit an assassination, regardless of their will to.

Cw: somewhat political

&gt;!The grammar of this language is based off Haitian Creole (because the slaves overthrew their masters, a sort of metaphor for freedom), and the vocabulary is sourced from several languages of nations that have had protests recently, such as Indonesian (Protests against laws that would ban extra-marital sex and shit-talking the dictator) and Cantonese (Anti-CCP Protests in Hong Kong.) The vocabulary sources also include Uighur, the language of 2 million or so turkic Muslims being detained by the CCP, and Rotwelsch, a language spoken by criminals and vagrants in Germany before around the 1960's (just some nice ""fuck the police"" culture in there). Been looking for Anti-American languages, if you have any recommendations leave some in the comments. Maybe Mohawk since they had that siege thing?!&lt;

For you guys that enjoyed my future Appalachian English post I made a while back, I'm planning on revamping that conlang. *If Future Appalatchin was so good, where's Future Appalatchin 2?* Coming soon to a subreddit near you. 

Don't know if this violates rule 6 exactly, gonna put a content warning over the vocab part. But uh, yeah.",Translated one sentence into my conlang.,"Orthography:

Everything else here is the same as IPA.

Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self-preservation?

This here's a quote from the CIA project ""Artichoke,"" one of a series of illegal inhumane experiments performed by the CIA. Many of these projects were based on learning new interrogation methods, and  this one studied such things as hypnosis, forced morphine addiction, potential of viruses to be used in interrogation, LSD, and other experimental drugs. These projects were done overseas as well, in Europe, Japan, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia. One of the primary goals of Project Artichoke was to determine whether or not they could get an individual to commit an assassination, regardless of their will to.

Cw: somewhat political

&gt;!The grammar of this language is based off Haitian Creole (because the slaves overthrew their masters, a sort of metaphor for freedom), and the vocabulary is sourced from several languages of nations that have had protests recently, such as Indonesian (Protests against laws that would ban extra-marital sex and shit-talking the dictator) and Cantonese (Anti-CCP Protests in Hong Kong.) The vocabulary sources also include Uighur, the language of 2 million or so turkic Muslims being detained by the CCP, and Rotwelsch, a language spoken by criminals and vagrants in Germany before around the 1960's (just some nice ""fuck the police"" culture in there). Been looking for Anti-American languages, if you have any recommendations leave some in the comments. Maybe Mohawk since they had that siege thing?!&lt;

1991,0,"So I love different bases and wanted to see what it would look like to make a language concept that uses base prime...I then got bored of typing a lot so I wrote some code to do it for me.

**Here are the 3 rules I adhered to**:  
Rule 1: Each prime gets it's own word

Rule 2: When building composites put primes together: 6 = 2,3 = dami. 

Rule 3 (S abbreviation): When multiple of the same number are used, use forumal: XsN X number of Ns 9 = dasmi. Meaning ""2 threes""  


**Primes I chose**:

primes = {  
 1: ""or"",  
 2: ""da"",  
 3: ""mi"",  
 5: ""su"",  
 7: ""wo"",  
 11: ""ki"",  
 13: ""ne"",  
 17: ""to"",  
 19: ""ra"",  
 23: ""ya"",  
 29: ""la"",  
 31: ""ena"",  
 37: ""be"",  
 41: ""fo"",  
 43: ""sta"",  
 47: ""no""  
}

Here is the code: [https://pastebin.com/LgZpT6yF](https://pastebin.com/LgZpT6yF)",Base Prime numbers with Python (Code at end of post),"So I love different bases and wanted to see what it would look like to make a language concept that uses base prime...I then got bored of typing a lot so I wrote some code to do it for me.

**Here are the 3 rules I adhered to**:  
Rule 1: Each prime gets it's own word

Rule 2: When building composites put primes together: 6 = 2,3 = dami. 

Rule 3 (S abbreviation): When multiple of the same number are used, use forumal: XsN X number of Ns 9 = dasmi. Meaning ""2 threes""  


**Primes I chose**:

primes = {  
 1: ""or"",  
 2: ""da"",  
 3: ""mi"",  
 5: ""su"",  
 7: ""wo"",  
 11: ""ki"",  
 13: ""ne"",  
 17: ""to"",  
 19: ""ra"",  
 23: ""ya"",  
 29: ""la"",  
 31: ""ena"",  
 37: ""be"",  
 41: ""fo"",  
 43: ""sta"",  
 47: ""no""  
}

&amp;#x200B;

**Sample output**

Here you can see the number - the number with ""S abbreviation"" -- and the number with only Rule 2 in play

Ancestral Aunaic is the language of the ancestors of most of the north-western folk. This language is intended to be the ancestor language of several other languages. It is based on PIE and Semitic languages and inspired by Tolkein's Adûnaic.

# Morphology

Roots are made up of 3 consonants called a radical, this radical is inserted into patterns to create words. The medial element (the second consonant) of this radical is always a consonant with a vocalic variant (i.e. a semivowel or syllabic consonant). Below is the list of consonants with vocalic elements.

&amp;#x200B;

|Consonantal|Vocalic|
|:-|:-|
|ʕ|a|
|j|i|
|w|u|
|m|ḿ|
|n|ń|
|r|ŕ|
|l|ĺ|

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if the radical LWN (carrying) is inserted into the pattern CCCa, it yields lwna &gt; luna. If the radical SȜTʰ  (working) is inserted into the pattern CaCC, it yields saȝtʰ &gt; sātʰ. If SND (hearing, sound) is inserted into 'aCCC it yields 'asnd &gt; 'asńd. Currently, these patterns don't mean much, since I am still deciding what they should mean.

More often than not, only /a/ forms a part of patterns, /i/ and /u/ only resulting from syllabic /j/ and /w/ (though I may change this). When /a/ is in the last syllable of a word, and occurs before a sonorant (/m n l r w j/) it becomes geminated (a &gt; ā).

# Evolution

The main goal of this language is to serve as the basis for future languages, I currently plan to split the language into 2 branches, Nordic and Southron. Nordic is intended to sound more Germanic, while Southron is intended to sound more Semitic but is also intended to have Indo-Iranian or Slavic features (as Southron covers a much wider, more diverse area). As such below is a non-exhaustive list of some direct sound change ideas which are intended to be similar to those sound changes directly off of PIE (but not as complex).
